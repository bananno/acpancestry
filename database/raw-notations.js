The mountains of Northern New Jersey abound in deposits of iron ore, and in the early part of the last century, iron-making was the principal industry, the abundant forests supplying great quantities of charcoal, a fuel needed for smelting and refining the ore. A forge was purchased for young Silas and his brother DeWint, within the boundaries of what is now the town of Stockholm, New Jersey, on the banks of the Pequannock River, at the junction of the main road with the lowest of the four roads which now lead from Stockholm to the village of Holland. This forge bore the name of \"Herring Bone Forge,\" due, it is said, to the bones of herring fish cast away at lunch time by the workmen employed there. DeWint soon withdrew from the partnership, to operate a forge of his own at Canistear. The subsequent failure of Silas was a natural consequence of his lack of experience in the iron business. He was overwhelmed by debts and pursued by the constable, who would come every little while and levy on his household goods and sell them at constable sale.","tags":{},"source":"5db5fd46cf6405834670f5db","stories":["5db5fb58cf6405834670f5d6"],"date":{"year":0,"month":0,"day":0},"location":{}},
