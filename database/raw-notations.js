There is no mention of an Edward in any of the biographies that list all of the Clifton siblings, and Susan would have been at least 50 when he was born. Research eventually revealed that he was actually their orphaned grandson, William Edward Rambo.","tags":{"broken brick wall":true},"stories":[]},

According to later census records, she was born in Sweden and so were her parents. She moved to Denmark at some point, where her husband and all of her children were born. Her last name was probably spelled differently before she moved to Denmark; possibly \"Peterson\".","tags":{"research notes":true,"brick wall":true},"stories":[]},

He was probably the son of Remington Sheldon and Huldah Greene: their son Thomas lived c. 1791 - 1817 and died in St. Pierre, Martinique.

I haven't found any records of her after this point.\r\nDuring the voyage, her 2-year-old brother Ole died of diphtheria, as noted on the immigration record. It's possible that she also died and that the note was supposed to apply to her as well. If not, it seems that she then died within a few years of the move, because her parents had another daughter named Elizabeth born in 1889. (Several of our ancestors did this - reused a name if the first child died young.)","tags":{"brick wall":true,"profile summary":true},"stories":[]},

One fall in Kansas when Anna was taking cattle from the cornfield into another pasture, one of the animals charged her, knocking her down. Kelly came to Anna's rescue, barking and biting until Victor, who was in another field husking corn, heard Anna's cries for help and came to rescue her.\r\nThe first dog that took the place of \"Hero Kelly\" was named Midger and all dogs thereafter had the common name of Midger.","tags":{},"source":"5bd9cfe84d3a6a4ba8038bca","stories":["5d982f4ae9818f1b4a879c36"]},

He expected to start the next day to St. Thomas.\" It doesn't mention whether he meant to move permanently or planned to return home eventually, but he did leave behind a wife and children. Thousands of Southerners migrated to Brazil after the Civil War; today their descendants are known as Confederados.
