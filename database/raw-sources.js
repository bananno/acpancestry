B. JOHNSON (1879) is retired from active pursuits and resides in Ruthton. He was born in Denmark April 15, 1851, and in that country he attended school and grew to manhood on a farm. At the age of twenty years he came to the United States and settled in St. Louis. In 1879 he located in Pipestone county, taking as a homestead claim the northeast quarter of section 2, Aetna township. Mr. Johnson was one of the first settlers of Aetna township and is one of the few remaining homesteaders in the precinct. His first house was a dug-out, the lumber in the roof of which was hauled from Tracy. The initial home was replaced in 1880 with a house of lumber, the building being completed by the construction of an addition in 1888. He set out a big grove and otherwise improved the homestead, land which he still owns.\r\nThe subject of this review passed through the days of Pipestone county's early history when twisted hay was used for fuel to supply warmth during the long, cold winters.\r\nIn 1887, when the Great Northern railroad was building through the county, the chief engineer and his crew stopped at Mr. Johnson's house for several months and were compelled to twist hay to keep from freezing. Ten years ago Mr. Johnson erected a fine house in the village of Ruthton, and since that time has led a retired life.\r\nO. B. Johnson is the son of John Johanson and Margareta Johanson. The father died in the old country; the mother came to the United States with her son in 1871 and died in Ruthton in 1894, at the age of seventy-four years. The following named children of this family are living: Hans, Peter, Ole, Mary and Anna.\r\nO. B. Johnson was married at LaCrosse, Wisconsin, October 22, 1872, to Miss Anna L. C. Young, who was born in Christianstad, Sweden. Both are members of the Methodist church of Ruthton. Mr. and Mrs. Johnson have two children: Oscar, of Lignite, North Dakota, and Alma (Mrs. Ben D. Martinson), of Ruthton.","notes":"page 669","tags":{"biography":true}},

JOSEPH J. BELL, retired, Jesup, was born in Tattnall County, Ga., May 31, 1840.  His parents are Joseph J. and Elizabeth (Johnson) Bell, the father a native of North Carolina and the mother of Georgia.  Both paternal and maternal grandparents came from North Carolina in an early day.  Our subject’s father was a farmer; attended strictly to that business, and in that pursuit was eminently successful.  He was a man of deep-laid principles and rim integrity, highly honored and respected wherever he was known.  His death occurred April 2, 1858, at the age of fifty-eight years.  His wife was a worthy companion for such a husband, and was greatly loved and respected.  Her death occurred October 15, 1847, at the age of thirty-seven.  These parents were married in 1828.  They had twelve children; six are still living, viz.: Mary, wife of J. B. Stripling, of Florida; Frances, wife of Hon. S. P. Smith, of Perry’s Mills, Ga.; subject; Anna S., wife of D. J. Mims, of Florida; Capt. A. D., of Florida, married Fannie E. Baggs; Henrietta, wife of M. M. Futch, of Thomasville, Ga.

On his return, was in Atlanta campaign until it fell; was then promoted to colonel; was in Hood’s army and Chapin’s division until the close of the war.  Received his discharge at Doctortown, Ga.  After the war closed he engaged in the lumber business and farming until 1874.  Since then his business has been farming and stock-raising, in which he has been quite successful.  He has served as justice of the peace for four years.  He has also served as school commissioner for a series of terms.  He was married in 1860 to Miss Mary A. Mims, daughter of William and Rebecca (Nail) Mims, of Richmond County, Ga., though natives of South Carolina.  The issue of this marriage has been six children, namely: Rebecca M., Elizabeth J., wife of Engineer W. C. Burns, living in Jesup; William A. married Miss Ida A. Goodbread: Sarah M., wife of C. E. Gilmore, of Atlanta, conductor on the E. T. Va. & Ga. R. R.; Emma L., wife of A. T. Watson, of Macon; Georgia L.  Both parents and four children are members of the Methodist Episcopal Church.  Col Bell is a member of the Masonic order, and one who has always been recognized as a man of honor and integrity and throughout his life has enjoyed the friendship and confidence of all with whom he has been associated.","notes":"The military timeline is not chronological. Not sure what year he had typhoid fever; it couldn't be right before the Atlanta Campaign because the city fell in September.","tags":{"biography":true}},

He enlisted (as did his brothers Thomas and Harrison) in Company G, Fifth Georgia cavalry, state troops. The command was with Gen. Johnson’s forces, and participated in the battles at Kennesaw Mountain, around and at Atlanta, Nashville, and at Bentonville, N.C., remaining in the army until the surrender. After the war he engaged in farming, and to a limited extent in the manufacture of naval stores.

He was in the senate during the celebrated impeachment trial of Goldsmith and Renfroe, etc. These continued honors indicate a popularity and public confidence quite rare, and undoubtedly gratifying to the recipient. Mr. Clifton was married April 19,1883, to Miss Amanda Coursey, born Aug. 13, 1868, daughter of T. J. Coursey, of Montgomery county, Ga. To them six children have been born; Olivia Robie, born Aug. 28, 1884; William Clisby, born March 6, 1886; Minnie Lou, born March 16, 1888; Benjamin Hill, born Feb. 8, 1890; Susan, born Feb. 21, died Dec. 27, 1892, and Minis Hunter, born April 14, 1894.

They lived on a small farm and lived to the ripe old age of ninety-three. They died in Denmark.\r\nMy great-grandfather was born in Denmark and was a great violinist. He died at the age of fifty-four. His violin was an old one and according to the date stamped on the inside of the violin, it is two hundred and twenty-seven years old. It is greatly cherished by my grandfather, Mr. O.B. Johnson, who now lives in the city of Ruthton, Minnesota.\r\nMy great-grandmother was born in Denmark and came to this country in 1871 with her son and two daughters. She settled in St. Louis, Missouri where her son resided. After living in St. Louis a short time, she came to Minnesota. For a while she lived in Winona, Minn. and from there came to Pipestone county. She took up a homestead on the Northeast Quarter of Section 32 of Etna Township. School was held in her home for two terms. She sold this homestead and moved to Ruthton, Minn. While in Ruthton, she built a *home on lot four, block four, and died in this place at the age of seventy-four years and eight months. She was buried in the Ruthton cemetery.\r\n[sic] Some of this was typed over and this is what we think it said.

In addition, they would collect birth, death, and marriage dates as well as where families had moved to or from and when, etc. The priest would then come back each year and update or edit the information from the previous year and note any changes in the population of the home. After 1894 the examinations were less focused on doctrinal knowledge and more focused on enumerating the Swedish population.

Mr. Smith was given the best education the schools of the county afforded, and then was sent to Hinesville (Liberty county, Ga) high school, at that time in charge of Prof. Bradwell, father of Hon. S. D. Bradwell, the late able state school commissioner. He succeeded his father in his mercantile business, and has also been engaged in farming. About 1861 he was elected justice of the peace and notary public in the district since. Just after the war he was appointed postmaster at Perry's Mills, and has held the office from that time until now.

His grandfather, John Sharpe, was a soldier in the revolutionary army, and came with his family from Halifax county, Va., to Georgia, early in this century, and settled in Burke county. Dr. Sharpe’s father was born Nov. 1,1795, and followed farming in Burke county. His wife was born in Burke county March 29,1795, and to them eight children were born, the doctor being the youngest, and of them four sons are now living: E.F., Kissimmee City, Fla.; John T., farmer, Tattnall county; Henry R., farmer, Lowndes county, and Robert M., the subject of this sketch. Dr. Sharpe was educated at the county common schools, attended Burke county high school two years and then attended school one year in Princess Anne county, Va. With this preliminary preparation he entered the medical college of Georgia, Augusta, and was graduated in 1859, receiving his diploma from Hon. Ebenezer Starnes, president. He located at once in Tattnall county, but before he got fairly started the unpleasantness occurred, and he enlisted in the army. Considering afterward that he could be of more service at home among the people, he placed a substitute and practiced in the county during the war, there being only one other physician in the county. With the exception of three years-1869-1871, when he practiced in Lowndes county-he has continuously practiced in Tattnall county. He has been successful, has the confidence and esteem of the people and enjoys an extensive practice. Dr. Sharpe, was married Feb. 16,1858, to Miss Mary J. Kennedy, born March 28,1841, daughter of Robert Kennedy, of Webster (originally from Monroe) county, Ga. This union was blessed with ten children, all living but the first-born, who died in infancy. They are as follows: Susan, born Aug. 26,1860, married John Davis, Tattnall county, and they have five children: Thomas R., born Oct. 2, 1862, married Miss Luray Smith, and they have one child; Roberta A., born Aug. 6,1865, married Jesse H. Little, of North Carolina, but now living in Tattnall county, and has four children; Anna, born April 28,1868, married D.

He was still breathing when taken out by the other men working there, but died before they could get him to the Sabetha hospital, to which he was rushed as soon as rescued from the pit.\r\nThe pit in which he was working was about 12 feet square and was to be 12 feet deep, to house some of the machinery used in drilling the test well on the Albin farm. It is said that Virgil had been warned that the sides should be shored, but that he considered it safe. The other men were working nearby, but none of them in a dangerous position. The falling dirt crushed him against the timber with terrific force, and he was never conscious after being taken out.\r\nBesides his widow and two small children, Mr. Allen is survived by his parents and five brothers and two sisters.\r\nFuneral services will be held at Bethany U.B. Church at Honey Creek, Friday afternoon at 2:30, with burial in Heim Cemetary, at Dawson.","notes":"Posted on Ancestry.com. Original clipping not found.","tags":{}},

Before lapsing into unconsciousness Mr. Olsen stated that when he started down the stairs he felt dizzy and sat down when things turned dark and he remembered no more. From this it is presumed that he suffered a slight stroke of apoplexy and while in this condition, rolled to the bottom. The injury to the head causing a blood clot.\r\nMr. Olsen has been a resident of this section for many years and was a neighbor well thought of and beloved by all, and his unexpected death was a shock to the entire community.\r\nChristian Olsen was born in Denmark in 1854 and when 28 years of age, with his wife and four children came to this country settling in Racine, Wisc., moving to this neighborhood in 1891 where he has since resided.\r\nThe funeral services were held at the Danish Lutheran church Tuesday after- noon at 3 o'clock. Rev. Pedersen conducts the last sad rites. The church was filled to overflowing by old neighbors and friends who followed the remains to the cemetery where the last respects were paid.\r\nThe deceased, for years, had been a member of the local Woodmen, and a part of the membership attended in a body out of respect for their departed brother and gave the Woodman honors at the grave.\r\nNine children are left to mourn the loss of a beloved father, they being Lena who resides at Doran, Marie, of Minneapolis, Tina, of Russell, Christina, who is a resident of Denmark, and Maggie, Lizzie, Peter, Nels and Chris, of Ruthton, who were in attendance with the exception of Chris who is in the Navy and could not be reached.

SHELDON PERKINS SMITH.\r\nWhen someone speaks of the grand old man of Lyons and Toombs County it is only the stranger in that community who has to be informed that reference is made to the venerable judge of the Probate Court, Sheldon Perkins Smith. Now nearly eighty-five years of age, practically his entire life has been one of unselfish service and devotion to his fellow men and his home community. It is common report in Toombs County that Judge Smith, as a result of his impulsive and broad-minded generosity, has given away a fortune. In fact he has apparently found his chief pleasure in helping those that needed help, regardless of politics, religion or creed. It would be difficult to conceive a higher degree of esteem than that paid by his fellow citizens to this fine old citizen of Lyons.\r\nBorn in the State of Rhode Island June 27, 1831, Judge Smith is a son of Nicholas Peck and Urania (Turtelott) Smith. America has been the home of this branch of the Smith family for about two centuries. The immigrant ancestor was Christopher Smith, who came from England and settled in Rhode Island, and his oldest son was Benjamin. The line of descent thenceforward is traced through Stephen, Simeon, Nicholas and finally Judge Smith. On the maternal side the Turtelott family were French Huguenots. Judge Smith's grandmother Dorcas Turtelott married Capt. Jonathan Aborn, who was master of a sailing vessel, and he died while on a voyage at Calcutta, India, in June, 1820. The family was established in Georgia by Nicholas Peck Smith, who in 1824 came to Tattnall County and established a mercantile enterprise. In 1832 he sent North for his family, and they made their home on the Altamaha River in Tattnall County, where he continued his career as a successful merchant and planter until his death in 1867 at the age of eighty years. His wife passed away in 1841. There was a large family of children, including the following: Dorcas, who died in Toombs County in February, 1911; Daniel, who died in Plainfield, New York; Urania, who married Farquhar McRae, and she died at Mount Vernon; Sheldon Perkins, next in age; Nicholas P., who died of yellow fever at Savannah in 1876; Mary A., who first married Dr. Lucien Tucker, and is now the widow of Dr. James Harrison and resides in Washington, D. C.; Elizabeth died in Liberty County, Georgia, in 1858; Robert A. died at Charleston, South Carolina, in 1863 from typhoid fever while in the Confederate army. The daughter’s, were all educated in the Ladies' Seminary at Warren, Rhode Island.\r\nJudge Smith finished his education under a private tutor, Col. J. S. Bradwell, at Hinesville, Georgia. For a number of years he was with his father in the store, until the latter's death, and then employed his resources in merchandising and planting in Tattnall County. The most prominent feature of his career, however, has not been his business success, but his official service. During the Civil war Governor Joseph E. Brown, the war governor of Georgia, appointed him justice of the peace for Tattnall, later Toombs County, and that office he filled with admirable ability and with an administration of justice which was firm but kindly, sympathetic and interested, for fully half a century, from 1863 until 1913. In 1913 Judge Smith was elected Judge of Probate or Ordinary for Toombs County, and in that dignified and useful office it is likely that he will spend his last days. Judge Smith has always been an admirer of the principles of Masonry, though he has never joined the order himself.\r\nOn December 5, 1853, in Tattnall County he married Miss Frances Bell, who was born in Tattnall County, a daughter of Joseph and Elizabeth E. (Johnson) Bell. Her mother was the daughter of Allen E. Johnson. After more than half a century of married companionship Mrs. Smith passed away in June, 1908. Thirteen children were born to her, and a number of them are still living and filling dignified and useful positions in the world. Elizabeth died in 1871; Frances E. is the wife of Harrison Clifton, of Toombs County; Dorcas married Henry Mann and died in Toombs County; Joseph B. is a resident of Kingsland, Georgia; Sheldon P. lives in Geneva, Florida; Nicholas was accidentally killed by the Southern Railway at Baxley, Georgia; Mary, who married Dan McMillan died in Montgomery County, Georgia; Octavia died in Tattnall County; Robert is now state representative from Toombs County and a farmer in that locality; Allen is an engineer for the Georgia Southern Railway at Valdosta; Daisy is the wife of J. A. Pearson, who alternates in residence between Savannah and Tattnall County; Simeon died in infancy; Louise lives at home with her father in Lyons.\r\nPrior to the war both Judge Smith and his father owned from forty to fifty slaves and conducted one of the largest plantations in Tattnall County. However, slavery was not an institution which Judge Smith favored, and he literally fought the secession movement in Georgia, and for that reason aroused much ill feeling and prejudice against him. The unpopularity of that time has long since passed away, and the views which he advocated almost alone have long since been accepted by the great majority of right thinking people.\r\n[below: Family lists according the original text, reformatted]\r\n| 1 | Dorcas | | died in Toombs County in February, 1911\r\n| 2 | Daniel | | died in Plainfield, New York\r\n| 3 | Urania | married Farquhar McRae | died at Mount Vernon\r\n| 4 | Sheldon Perkins | |\r\n| 5 | Nicholas P. | | died of yellow fever at Savannah in 1876\r\n| 6 | Mary A. | first married Dr. Lucien Tucker, and is now the widow of Dr. James Harrison and resides in Washington, D.

The origin of the personal name is Czechoslovakian, 'Wenze' being a borrowed form of the Old Czech personal name 'Veceslav', in modern Czech 'Vaclav', which in its Anglicized form is 'Wenceslas'. The name is composed of the elements 'vece', greater, and 'slav', glory, and was borne by a 10th Century duke of bohemia who fought against a revival of paganism in this territory, and after his death became patron saint of Bohemia. There are a number of variants of the name 'Wenzel(l)', such as 'Wentzel', 'Wanzel', and 'Fenzl', and the patronymic (son of Wenzel), 'Wen(t)zler'. One Christopher Wenzel married Elisabeth Braks at Spitalfields, Christchurch (London) in January 1780. The first recorded spelling of the family name is shown to be that of John Wenzell (marriage to Elisabeth Pope), which was dated April 27th 1766, St. Dunstan's, Stepney, London, during the reign of King George 111, 'Farmer George', 1760 - 1820. Surnames became necessary when governments introduced personal taxation. In England this was known as Poll Tax. Throughout the centuries, surnames in every country have continued to \"develop\" often leading to astonishing variants of the original spelling.\r\n© Copyright: Name Origin Research 1980 - 2017","tags":{}},

(Page 8)\r\nWill Nemechek was here last week visiting friends and looking after business matters. Since leaving Table Rock he has had quite an experience. Two years ago he was in the flood district in Texas, and lost everything they had, except what clothing they had on. For forty-eight hours they were marooned on a hill without food, surrounded by torrents of raging water. After they were rescued from their position on the hill, their food supply was short for nearly a week longer, as there was only one store in the vicinity above water and the food stuffs of this store were proportioned out to families on a very economical basis. As the waters subsided other stocks were uncovered, but much of the food stuffs were spoiled, but enough was saved to supply the people with enough to live on until the railroads were again in operation and brought i n supplies. But it was an experience Will does not want repeated, and as soon as possible he let go of his Texas holdings and moved to Washington County, Kansas. He says his crops this season were damaged, but that he raised enough to see him through the winter and he will enter upon his farm work with renewed energy and hope and expects to win out in the long run.","notes":"Article was pasted into FindAGrave.

He was married in Tattnall County on April 27, 1836 to Miss Susannah Sharpe, a daughter of John Thomas Sharpe and his wife Rebecca Lassiter. She was a native of Tattnall County, having been born there on Tuesday, February 1, 1820. The Cliftons made their home in the present-day Marvin community of Toombs County.\r\nWilliam Clifton served as Colonel of the 6th Regiment Militia, a position which he acquired on April 19, 1836. He was instrumental in defending the ar[ea?] in Indian conflicts in 1838. He was also prominent in politics and served as Justice of the Peace, Clerk of Court, Justice of the Inferior Court and stat representative at various times throughout the period prior to the Civil War.\r\nAccording to the \"Memoirs of Georgia\", William \"made a life pursuit of farming and stock raising, but having developed under the instruction of Christopher Bowland, the famous Irish mathematician, unusual mathematical ability, made an enviable reputation as a surveyor. He was employed by the United States Government to survey portions of the Cherokee country in north Georgia, and was highly complimented by the then governor of the state for the excellence of his work.\"\r\nColonel William Clifton died on his plantation in southern Toombs County (then Tattnall) on Sunday, December 21, 1873. He was buried in the Clifton Family Cemetery on the right side of this homeplace, adjacent to the Old River Road. Today, this cemetery is one of the best kept and tended resting places in all the county. William left a will recorded in the Tattnall County which divided his property amongst his children.\r\nHis widow, Susannah (Sharpe) Clifton, continued residing on the homeplace until her death on Saturday, February 21, 1904. Her remains were laid to rest beside her husband.\r\nMr. S. H. Whonic of Jesup, Georgia has done considerable research on this branch of the Clifton clan.","tags":{}},

The Cliftons came to Georgia in 1780 and made their home along the Great Ogeechee River at \"Clifton's Ferry\", south of Scarborough in present—day Jenkins County. After reaching adulthood, Ezekiel moved to Montgomery County to that section that was later cut into Tattnall County. He was married about 1795 to Miss Elizabeth Roberts, a daughter of Nathan Roberts. She was the same age as Ezekiel, having been born in 1773 in North Carolina. The Cliftons made their home in southeast Toombs County in present—day Marvin community. Ezekiel and Elizabeth were the parents of the following children:\r\n|| || Name || Born || Married\r\n| 1 | Nathan Clifton | Dec. 25, 1797 | Versaney\r\n| 1 | Nathan Clifton | Dec. 25, 1797 | Versaney\r\n| 2 | Elizabeth Clifton | Feb. 8, 1799 | Never Married\r\n| 3 | Martha Clifton | Jan. 23, 1801 | McLendon Ganey\r\n| 4 | William Clifton | Jun. 24, 1803 | Susannah Sharpe\r\n| 5 | Levin Clifton | Feb. 13, 1806 | Martha Ganey\r\n| 6 | Harriett Clifton | Jun. 1, 1808 | Rev.

He engaged in farming and stock raising, primarily hogs and goats. The Clifton plantation sat on a 400 acre tract of land bordering Pendleton Creek. Ezekiel also held title to property in other sections of the state, primarily Lowndes County and Houston County.\r\nEzekiel Clifton was elected as the first sheriff of Tattnall County, an office which he held for several terms. Having been elected Captain of the local militia, he became known state—vide for his leadership in numerous Indian battles. His service was instumental in the Battle at Echowanotchaway Swamp in Randolph County in west Georgia in late January of 1836.\r\nCaptain Ezekiel Clifton died at his home on Tuesday, August 17, 1852 and is said to have been laid to rest in the Old Clifton—harden Family Cemetery in Toombs County, on the property of Theron Morris. His will named his son William Clifton, Alexander McRae of Reidsville and Richard C.A. Bryan as executors of his estate. He left his daughter Elizabeth, a spinster, the plantation, provided that she care for her mother and to his son William, he left $1000. The remainder of his estate, which included goats, hogs, 295 bushels of corn and 1750 pounds of fodder, was divided amongst his heirs.\r\nElizabeth (Roberts) Clifton lived her golden years at the old homeplace with her daughter Elizabeth \"Betsy\" Clifton and died on December 21, 1873. Both she and Betsy were buried in the Old Clifton—Harden Family Graveyard.\r\nDates obtained by Mr. S. H. Whonic of Jesup, Georgia.","tags":{}},

At the age of 4, he moved with his family from Virginia to St. George Parish, Georgia, which became Burke County in 1777. He died 7 October 1835 (173 years ago) in Tattnall County, Georgia. \r\nJeanette Holland Austin recorded in her book, Deaths of Revolutionary War Soldiers Who Died in Georgia and their Widows, that in Burke County about 1792, John Sharpe married Elizabeth “Betsey” Wynn, six years his senior. She was born in 1755 in Virginia and died 25 October 1835 in Tattnall County, Georgia, just 18 days after the death of her husband.\r\nJohn and Betsey had three children:\r\n1. John Thomas Sharpe, born 1 November 1795 in Burke County, Georgia\r\n2. Susan Elizabeth Sharpe, born 1800 in Burke County, Georgia\r\n3. Hamilton Wynn Sharpe, born 10 April 1807 in Tattnall County, Georgia\r\nJohn Sharpe moved in 1802 with his wife and their first two children to bounty land in Tattnall County that he received for his service in the Revolutionary War. Their third child was born in Tattnall County. \r\nJohn took an active part in the newly formed county and its government. He served two different terms as Sheriff; Justice of the Peace in the 43rd District of Tattnall County 1816-1818; and Major in the 10th Battalion Georgia Militia 1830-1834. As administrator of his father’s estate after 1806, he defended himself in court a number of times. He maintained a tavern of some sort, as several times he was granted license to sell liquor for 12 months. Several different times he was accused in court of wrongful activities. Sometimes he won the case - other times he lost.\r\nA death notice for John Sharpe was published in the Milledgeville, Georgia newspaper, The Southern Recorder, issue of 10 November 1835 as follows:\r\n“Another Revolutionary Patriot Gone! Died at his residence in Tattnall County on October 7th of bilious fever, Major John Sharpe in his 73rd year. At an early age he took up arms in defense of his country. In all his dealings, honesty and truth were strictly adhered to. He left an aged widow, but not for long as she died on 25th of October following. They had been married over 48 years. They leave behind two sons”.\r\nIn his book Sketches of By-Gone Days, Mr. Joseph T. Grice lists 44 names of Revolutionary Soldiers who made their homes in Tattnall County soon after its creation. He listed John Sharpe among them. Mr. Grice states of these men, “They made substantial contributions to the development of our county, many of them being large property owners and filling places of responsibility and trust among their fellows.\r\nAs their service to the Nation contributed to the winning of our war for independence, so did they contribute to the building of a good civilization here, and their descendants in the county today can well point with pride to the activities of their ancestors who came here in the long ago”.\r\nOn page one of Revolutionary Soldiers in Georgia, Volume III, Mrs. Howard H. McCall pays homage to our Patriot ancestors:\r\n“Many years have rolled away since the stirring scenes of the Revolution were acted, but the brilliant events of that period will live on the pages of history.\r\nThe names of those Revolutionary Soldiers, who espoused the popular cause and threw the whole weight of their power and influence on the side of Liberty, are on the Nation’s Roll of Honor.\r\nWhile the Revolutionary Army of Georgia was small compared to many other Colonies, it was our State, Georgia, which offered land in quantity as an inducement to Revolutionary Soldiers of all the States to settle in Georgia.\r\nTruly we can say these Revolutionary Soldiers from Georgia and the other Colonies helped to secure for us our glorious heritage.”\r\nBarbara Jo Mills Baker\r\n4th-Gr-Granddaughter of John Sharpe, Jr., R.S.\r\nOn the occasion of his Dedication of Revolutionary Soldier Grave Marker, Clifton Family Cemetery, Toombs County, Georgia.\r\n9 October 2008","tags":{}},

He ran away from home at age 10, went to Denmark. He worked in a \"home bakery\" and undoubtedly that was where he learned to be a baker.[citation 1] He moved as a young man to Kristianstad, Malmö, later. Came back to Agunnaryd in 1879. He learned the bakery trade and changed his name during that time to Winblad. He moved from Agunnaryd to Pjätteryd 20 Sep 1879. Here he worked in the bakery till 26 Nov 1879. He married Clara Magnidotter on 30 Dec 1879. \r\nAnna and Wilhelm were born in Pjättaryd where Peter was a crofter (farm renter) and then a carpenter. Peter got the testimonials to move to northern Sweden 19 Apr 1884, but the family moved instead to Stockholm City. Here was born Carl. Peter emigrated from Stockholm via Götenberg to St. Paul on the ship Orlando on 25 May 1888. \r\nClara Magnidotter was born 19 Aug 1859 in Yxnäs, Sweden. She was the daughter of Magnus Esbjörnsson and Anna Stina Andersdotter in Yxnäs. She came from a poor stony part of Sweden and had to work very hard. She was also an orphan.[citation 2] She had a younger sister, Emma Marie born 29 Mar 1866. Clara's father died 23 Nov 1867; her mother 30 Oct 1869; Clara was only 10 years old – making she and her sister orphans – as Wilma said. It is not known what happened to them. They are listed on the Swedish household record of 1869 – 1876 by themselves. (Emma left Sweden from Stockholm 4 Jul 1894 going to Halifax. She left with 1 adult male named Anders Gustaf Kjellberg, her illegitimate son named Karl Gustaf born 3 Nov 1893 in Katarina Parish in Stockholm and a female foster child named Elvira Eleonora. On the Stockholm birth record for Elvira Eleonora there are no parents listed.)[citation 3] Clara went to work in Hjörtsborg parish in 1876 – 1877. At age 21 Clara came to the United States with children Anna, Wilhelm and Carl on 21 Sep 1888 on the ship Romeo. She was pregnant with twins, Esther and Esten. On the trip she had a very bad tooth ache. People on the ship thought the pain she was having was labor pains.[citation 4]\r\nThey came to Peter who was in St. Paul. From St. Paul to Freya, Wisconsin; then to Milaca. Peter was a baker and had a bakery in Milaca (see Appendix O). Peter was a small, jolly man and played the accordion.[citation 4] He lived with Clarence and Pearl Fix the last few years and died in their home.[citation 5] Clara died 24 Feb 1930; Peter August died of old age and cardiac failure 19 Jun 1939 (See Appendix P).\r\n[below: Citations included in the document]\r\n(1) Wilma Nyberg\r\n(2) Wilma Nyberg\r\n(3) Ann Wieck\r\n(4) Emily Skildum [sic: two of them labeled \"4\"]\r\n(4) Wilma Nyberg\r\n(5) Lois Fix Gravel","tags":{}},

The father and mother are natives of Norway have lived in America for nearly fifty years and are now residents of Parker, South Dakota.\r\nIn Mason City, Iowa, on November 27, 1870, Ben D.

In early childhood he moved with his parents to Council Bluffs, Iowa, lived with them four years in Kansas, and later in Minneapolis and in North and South Dakota, and finally returned to Iowa. The removals were necessitated by his father's occupation, that of railroading. The father later became a farmer in Wright county, Iowa, and was located near the town of Belmont. There Ben lived until after his twenty-second birthday, leaving home at that time to locate in Ruthton. For three years he was engaged in the well drilling business and then farmed in Aetna township until 1901.
