B. JOHNSON (1879) is retired from active pursuits and resides in Ruthton. He was born in Denmark April 15, 1851, and in that country he attended school and grew to manhood on a farm. At the age of twenty years he came to the United States and settled in St. Louis. In 1879 he located in Pipestone county, taking as a homestead claim the northeast quarter of section 2, Aetna township. Mr. Johnson was one of the first settlers of Aetna township and is one of the few remaining homesteaders in the precinct. His first house was a dug-out, the lumber in the roof of which was hauled from Tracy. The initial home was replaced in 1880 with a house of lumber, the building being completed by the construction of an addition in 1888. He set out a big grove and otherwise improved the homestead, land which he still owns.\r\nThe subject of this review passed through the days of Pipestone county's early history when twisted hay was used for fuel to supply warmth during the long, cold winters.\r\nIn 1887, when the Great Northern railroad was building through the county, the chief engineer and his crew stopped at Mr. Johnson's house for several months and were compelled to twist hay to keep from freezing. Ten years ago Mr. Johnson erected a fine house in the village of Ruthton, and since that time has led a retired life.\r\nO. B. Johnson is the son of John Johanson and Margareta Johanson. The father died in the old country; the mother came to the United States with her son in 1871 and died in Ruthton in 1894, at the age of seventy-four years. The following named children of this family are living: Hans, Peter, Ole, Mary and Anna.\r\nO. B. Johnson was married at LaCrosse, Wisconsin, October 22, 1872, to Miss Anna L. C. Young, who was born in Christianstad, Sweden. Both are members of the Methodist church of Ruthton. Mr. and Mrs. Johnson have two children: Oscar, of Lignite, North Dakota, and Alma (Mrs. Ben D. Martinson), of Ruthton.","notes":"page 669","story":"5d229d7a809463543856105f","stories":[],"tags":{"biography":true},"fullTitle":"An illustrated history of the counties of Rock and Pipestone, Minnesota - O.

JOSEPH J. BELL, retired, Jesup, was born in Tattnall County, Ga., May 31, 1840.  His parents are Joseph J. and Elizabeth (Johnson) Bell, the father a native of North Carolina and the mother of Georgia.  Both paternal and maternal grandparents came from North Carolina in an early day.  Our subject’s father was a farmer; attended strictly to that business, and in that pursuit was eminently successful.  He was a man of deep-laid principles and rim integrity, highly honored and respected wherever he was known.  His death occurred April 2, 1858, at the age of fifty-eight years.  His wife was a worthy companion for such a husband, and was greatly loved and respected.  Her death occurred October 15, 1847, at the age of thirty-seven.  These parents were married in 1828.  They had twelve children; six are still living, viz.: Mary, wife of J. B. Stripling, of Florida; Frances, wife of Hon. S. P. Smith, of Perry’s Mills, Ga.; subject; Anna S., wife of D. J. Mims, of Florida; Capt. A. D., of Florida, married Fannie E. Baggs; Henrietta, wife of M. M. Futch, of Thomasville, Ga.  The deceased are: Laura H., wife of Franklin Tillman, of Texas; Caroline G., who, with her husband, left Tennessee after marriage for New York by rail, there to take the steamer to Europe, but has never been heard from since.  Presumably was lost at sea.  Nathaniel A. left home with the intention of going to Brazil, S. A.  The last letter received from him was from Havana, Cuba, February 15, 1866.  Has never been heard from since.  He expected to start the next day to St. Thomas.  His wife’s maiden name was Sarah Mobley.  She died in 1874.  William R. died August 13, 1887.  His wife died 1876.  \r\nOur subject enlisted as a private March 4, 1862, in the Forty-seventh Georgia regiment of infantry.  Took part in battles of James Island, Lookout Mountain; was at home with typhoid fever from July to October.  On his return, was in Atlanta campaign until it fell; was then promoted to colonel; was in Hood’s army and Chapin’s division until the close of the war.  Received his discharge at Doctortown, Ga.  After the war closed he engaged in the lumber business and farming until 1874.  Since then his business has been farming and stock-raising, in which he has been quite successful.  He has served as justice of the peace for four years.  He has also served as school commissioner for a series of terms.  He was married in 1860 to Miss Mary A. Mims, daughter of William and Rebecca (Nail) Mims, of Richmond County, Ga., though natives of South Carolina.  The issue of this marriage has been six children, namely: Rebecca M., Elizabeth J., wife of Engineer W. C. Burns, living in Jesup; William A. married Miss Ida A. Goodbread: Sarah M., wife of C. E. Gilmore, of Atlanta, conductor on the E. T. Va. & Ga. R. R.; Emma L., wife of A. T. Watson, of Macon; Georgia L.  Both parents and four children are members of the Methodist Episcopal Church.  Col. Bell is a member of the Masonic order, and one who has always been recognized as a man of honor and integrity and throughout his life has enjoyed the friendship and confidence of all with whom he has been associated.","notes":"The military timeline is not chronological. Not sure what year he had typhoid fever; it couldn't be right before the Atlanta Campaign because the city fell in September.\r\nIt mentions that Joseph and Elizabeth Bell had 12 children, but it only names 6 living and 4 deceased.","story":"5d5cbe53a9b12bf4a2a75233","stories":[],"tags":{"biography":true},"fullTitle":"Biographical Souvenir of the States of Georgia and Florida - Col.

He married Miss Elizabeth Roberts, a native of Screven county, Ga., and engaged in stock raising.\r\n\r\nWilliam Clifton, father of the subject of this sketch, also made a life pursuit of farming and stock raising, but having developed under the instruction of Christopher Bowland, the famous Irish mathematician, unusual mathematical ability, made an enviable reputation as a surveyor.

He served at various times as clerk of the court and as a justice of the inferior court, and represented the county in the general assembly. He died Dec. 21, 1873. His widow, born Feb. 1, 1820, still survives, and is living on the old homestead in the southern part of Tattnall county.\r\n\r\nHis grandfather on his mother's side, Maj. John T. Sharpe, was the son of a soldier in the revolutionary war, a prosperous farmer and a prominent politician, having represented the county several times in the general assembly.\r\n\r\nMr. Clifton's parents reared to maturity nine children, seven of whom are now living: Maria, born April 22, 1837, married Dr. John Rambo, of South Carolina, who spent the latter part of his life in Georgia and died at Valdosta. He was a surveyor in the Confederate army. They had one child, Willie, who is a teacher in Tattnall county.

He is a prominent lawyer in Savannah, Ga., and has represented Chatham county two terms in the general assembly; Benjamin Hill, born Aug. 9, 1856, died Oct. 19, 1890.\r\n\r\nMr. Clifton was educated in the common schools of the country. He enlisted (as did his brothers Thomas and Harrison) in Company G, Fifth Georgia cavalry, state troops. The command was with Gen. Johnson’s forces, and participated in the battles at Kennesaw Mountain, around and at Atlanta, Nashville, and at Bentonville, N.C., remaining in the army until the surrender. After the war he engaged in farming, and to a limited extent in the manufacture of naval stores. He represented the second senatorial district in the general assembly four years before the adoption of the constitution of 1877, and was elected to represent the same district in the first election held after its adoption. He was in the senate during the celebrated impeachment trial of Goldsmith and Renfroe, etc. These continued honors indicate a popularity and public confidence quite rare, and undoubtedly gratifying to the recipient. Mr. Clifton was married April 19, 1883, to Miss Amanda Coursey, born Aug. 13, 1868, daughter of T. J. Coursey, of Montgomery county, Ga. To them six children have been born; Olivia Robie, born Aug. 28, 1884; William Clisby, born March 6, 1886; Minnie Lou, born March 16, 1888; Benjamin Hill, born Feb. 8, 1890; Susan, born Feb. 21, died Dec. 27, 1892, and Minis Hunter, born April 14, 1894.

When Mr. Smith was about a year old (1832) his parents migrated to Georgia and settled in Tattnall county, where his father engaged in merchandising. They had eight children, of whom Mr. Smith was the fourth, five of whom are now living. Mr. Smith was given the best education the schools of the county afforded, and then was sent to Hinesville (Liberty county, Ga) high school, at that time in charge of Prof. Bradwell, father of Hon. S. D. Bradwell, the late able state school commissioner. He succeeded his father in his mercantile business, and has also been engaged in farming. About 1861 he was elected justice of the peace and notary public in the district since. Just after the war he was appointed postmaster at Perry's Mills, and has held the office from that time until now. He was not in active service during the war, but he represented Tattnall county (1863-65) in the general assembly. He was married Dec. 5, 1853, in Tattnall county, to Miss Frances Bell, born Aug. 15, 1833, daughter of Joseph J. and Elizabeth (Johnson) Bell, of Tattnall county.

His grandfather, John Sharpe, was a soldier in the revolutionary army, and came with his family from Halifax county, Va., to Georgia, early in this century, and settled in Burke county. Dr. Sharpe’s father was born Nov. 1, 1795, and followed farming in Burke county. His wife was born in Burke county March 29, 1795, and to them eight children were born, the doctor being the youngest, and of them four sons are now living: E. F., Kissimmee City, Fla.; John T., farmer, Tattnall county; Henry R., farmer, Lowndes county, and Robert M., the subject of this sketch. Dr. Sharpe was educated at the county common schools, attended Burke county high school two years and then attended school one year in Princess Anne county, Va. With this preliminary preparation he entered the medical college of Georgia, Augusta, and was graduated in 1859, receiving his diploma from Hon. Ebenezer Starnes, president. He located at once in Tattnall county, but before he got fairly started the unpleasantness occurred, and he enlisted in the army. Considering afterward that he could be of more service at home among the people, he placed a substitute and practiced in the county during the war, there being only one other physician in the county. With the exception of three years-1869-1871, when he practiced in Lowndes county-he has continuously practiced in Tattnall county. He has been successful, has the confidence and esteem of the people and enjoys an extensive practice. Dr. Sharpe was married Feb. 16, 1858, to Miss Mary J. Kennedy, born March 28, 1841, daughter of Robert Kennedy, of Webster (originally from Monroe) county, Ga. This union was blessed with ten children, all living but the first-born, who died in infancy. They are as follows: Susan, born Aug. 26, 1860, married John Davis, Tattnall county, and they have five children: Thomas R., born Oct. 2, 1862, married Miss Luray Smith, and they have one child; Roberta A., born Aug. 6, 1865, married Jesse H. Little, of North Carolina, but now living in Tattnall county, and has four children; Anna, born April 28, 1868, married D. Armistead, Screven county; Claudius M., born Oct. 26, 1870, married Eliza Johnson, of Appling county, Ga., now living in Florida; Francis L., born Feb. 24, 1873; John H., born May 15, 1875; Emma L., born Dec. 19, 1877, and Robert M., Jr., born April 17, 1888. Possessing a fine estate, a competency, with an excellent practice that keeps him actively employed, and surrounded by his interesting family. Dr. Sharpe needs nothing to make life entirely enjoyable.","story":"5d5ded5ed81caafa6ec3756a","stories":[],"tags":{"biography":true},"fullTitle":"Memoirs of Georgia - Robert M. Sharpe biography"},

He shouted a warning and all but Allen escaped.\r\nIt was believed the victim of the cave-in was dead when his body was reached. The head was not more than a foot or so below the surface of the sliding wall which formed his grave. However, he was rushed to the Sabetha hospital for medical aid.\r\nAllen, a young farmer of the neighborhood, had secured work with the oil crew which began this week to sink the well for Ed Morgan and associates.","notes":"Posted on Ancestry.com.

He was still breathing when taken out by the other men working there, but died before they could get him to the Sabetha hospital, to which he was rushed as soon as rescued from the pit.\r\nThe pit in which he was working was about 12 feet square and was to be 12 feet deep, to house some of the machinery used in drilling the test well on the Albin farm. It is said that Virgil had been warned that the sides should be shored, but that he considered it safe. The other men were working nearby, but none of them in a dangerous position. The falling dirt crushed him against the timber with terrific force, and he was never conscious after being taken out.\r\nBesides his widow and two small children, Mr. Allen is survived by his parents and five brothers and two sisters.\r\nFuneral services will be held at Bethany U.B. Church at Honey Creek, Friday afternoon at 2:30, with burial in Heim Cemetary, at Dawson.","notes":"Posted on Ancestry.com.

Before lapsing into unconsciousness Mr. Olsen stated that when he started down the stairs he felt dizzy and sat down when things turned dark and he remembered no more. From this it is presumed that he suffered a slight stroke of apoplexy and while in this condition, rolled to the bottom. The injury to the head causing a blood clot.\r\nMr. Olsen has been a resident of this section for many years and was a neighbor well thought of and beloved by all, and his unexpected death was a shock to the entire community.\r\nChristian Olsen was born in Denmark in 1854 and when 28 years of age, with his wife and four children came to this country settling in Racine, Wisc., moving to this neighborhood in 1891 where he has since resided.\r\nThe funeral services were held at the Danish Lutheran church Tuesday after- noon at 3 o'clock. Rev. Pedersen conducts the last sad rites. The church was filled to overflowing by old neighbors and friends who followed the remains to the cemetery where the last respects were paid.\r\nThe deceased, for years, had been a member of the local Woodmen, and a part of the membership attended in a body out of respect for their departed brother and gave the Woodman honors at the grave.\r\nNine children are left to mourn the loss of a beloved father, they being Lena who resides at Doran, Marie, of Minneapolis, Tina, of Russell, Christina, who is a resident of Denmark, and Maggie, Lizzie, Peter, Nels and Chris, of Ruthton, who were in attendance with the exception of Chris who is in the Navy and could not be reached. To them is extended the sympathy of the neighborhood.","notes":"This is copied from Johnson Family History.

SHELDON PERKINS SMITH.\r\nWhen someone speaks of the grand old man of Lyons and Toombs County it is only the stranger in that community who has to be informed that reference is made to the venerable judge of the Probate Court, Sheldon Perkins Smith. Now nearly eighty-five years of age, practically his entire life has been one of unselfish service and devotion to his fellow men and his home community. It is common report in Toombs County that Judge Smith, as a result of his impulsive and broad-minded generosity, has given away a fortune. In fact he has apparently found his chief pleasure in helping those that needed help, regardless of politics, religion or creed. It would be difficult to conceive a higher degree of esteem than that paid by his fellow citizens to this fine old citizen of Lyons.\r\nBorn in the State of Rhode Island June 27, 1831, Judge Smith is a son of Nicholas Peck and Urania (Turtelott) Smith. America has been the home of this branch of the Smith family for about two centuries. The immigrant ancestor was Christopher Smith, who came from England and settled in Rhode Island, and his oldest son was Benjamin. The line of descent thenceforward is traced through Stephen, Simeon, Nicholas and finally Judge Smith. On the maternal side the Turtelott family were French Huguenots. Judge Smith's grandmother Dorcas Turtelott married Capt. Jonathan Aborn, who was master of a sailing vessel, and he died while on a voyage at Calcutta, India, in June, 1820. The family was established in Georgia by Nicholas Peck Smith, who in 1824 came to Tattnall County and established a mercantile enterprise. In 1832 he sent North for his family, and they made their home on the Altamaha River in Tattnall County, where he continued his career as a successful merchant and planter until his death in 1867 at the age of eighty years. His wife passed away in 1841. There was a large family of children, including the following: Dorcas, who died in Toombs County in February, 1911; Daniel, who died in Plainfield, New York; Urania, who married Farquhar McRae, and she died at Mount Vernon; Sheldon Perkins, next in age; Nicholas P., who died of yellow fever at Savannah in 1876; Mary A., who first married Dr. Lucien Tucker, and is now the widow of Dr. James Harrison and resides in Washington, D. C.; Elizabeth died in Liberty County, Georgia, in 1858; Robert A. died at Charleston, South Carolina, in 1863 from typhoid fever while in the Confederate army. The daughters were all educated in the Ladies' Seminary at Warren, Rhode Island.\r\nJudge Smith finished his education under a private tutor, Col. J. S. Bradwell, at Hinesville, Georgia. For a number of years he was with his father in the store, until the latter's death, and then employed his resources in merchandising and planting in Tattnall County. The most prominent feature of his career, however, has not been his business success, but his official service. During the Civil war Governor Joseph E. Brown, the war governor of Georgia, appointed him justice of the peace for Tattnall, later Toombs County, and that office he filled with admirable ability and with an administration of justice which was firm but kindly, sympathetic and interested, for fully half a century, from 1863 until 1913. In 1913 Judge Smith was elected Judge of Probate or Ordinary for Toombs County, and in that dignified and useful office it is likely that he will spend his last days. Judge Smith has always been an admirer of the principles of Masonry, though he has never joined the order himself.\r\nOn December 5, 1853, in Tattnall County he married Miss Frances Bell, who was born in Tattnall County, a daughter of Joseph and Elizabeth E. (Johnson) Bell. Her mother was the daughter of Allen E. Johnson. After more than half a century of married companionship Mrs. Smith passed away in June, 1908. Thirteen children were born to her, and a number of them are still living and filling dignified and useful positions in the world. Elizabeth died in 1871; Frances E. is the wife of Harrison Clifton, of Toombs County; Dorcas married Henry Mann and died in Toombs County; Joseph B. is a resident of Kingsland, Georgia; Sheldon P. lives in Geneva, Florida; Nicholas was accidentally killed by the Southern Railway at Baxley, Georgia; Mary, who married Dan McMillan died in Montgomery County, Georgia; Octavia died in Tattnall County; Robert is now state representative from Toombs County and a farmer in that locality; Allen is an engineer for the Georgia Southern Railway at Valdosta; Daisy is the wife of J. A. Pearson, who alternates in residence between Savannah and Tattnall County; Simeon died in infancy; Louise lives at home with her father in Lyons.\r\nPrior to the war both Judge Smith and his father owned from forty to fifty slaves and conducted one of the largest plantations in Tattnall County. However, slavery was not an institution which Judge Smith favored, and he literally fought the secession movement in Georgia, and for that reason aroused much ill feeling and prejudice against him. The unpopularity of that time has long since passed away, and the views which he advocated almost alone have long since been accepted by the great majority of right thinking people.\r\n[below: Family lists according the original text, reformatted]\r\n| 1 | Dorcas | | died in Toombs County in February, 1911\r\n| 2 | Daniel | | died in Plainfield, New York\r\n| 3 | Urania | married Farquhar McRae | died at Mount Vernon\r\n| 4 | Sheldon Perkins | |\r\n| 5 | Nicholas P. | | died of yellow fever at Savannah in 1876\r\n| 6 | Mary A. | first married Dr. Lucien Tucker, and is now the widow of Dr. James Harrison and resides in Washington, D.

The origin of the personal name is Czechoslovakian, 'Wenze' being a borrowed form of the Old Czech personal name 'Veceslav', in modern Czech 'Vaclav', which in its Anglicized form is 'Wenceslas'. The name is composed of the elements 'vece', greater, and 'slav', glory, and was borne by a 10th Century duke of bohemia who fought against a revival of paganism in this territory, and after his death became patron saint of Bohemia. There are a number of variants of the name 'Wenzel(l)', such as 'Wentzel', 'Wanzel', and 'Fenzl', and the patronymic (son of Wenzel), 'Wen(t)zler'. One Christopher Wenzel married Elisabeth Braks at Spitalfields, Christchurch (London) in January 1780. The first recorded spelling of the family name is shown to be that of John Wenzell (marriage to Elisabeth Pope), which was dated April 27th 1766, St. Dunstan's, Stepney, London, during the reign of King George 111, 'Farmer George', 1760 - 1820. Surnames became necessary when governments introduced personal taxation. In England this was known as Poll Tax. Throughout the centuries, surnames in every country have continued to \"develop\" often leading to astonishing variants of the original spelling.\r\n© Copyright: Name Origin Research 1980 - 2017","story":"5d6d805e90ebb4483be6d92c","stories":[],"tags":{},"fullTitle":"SurnameDB - Last name: Wenzel"},

Two years ago he was in the flood district in Texas, and lost everything they had, except what clothing they had on. For forty-eight hours they were marooned on a hill without food, surrounded by torrents of raging water. After they were rescued from their position on the hill, their food supply was short for nearly a week longer, as there was only one store in the vicinity above water and the food stuffs of this store were proportioned out to families on a very economical basis. As the waters subsided other stocks were uncovered, but much of the food stuffs were spoiled, but enough was saved to supply the people with enough to live on until the railroads were again in operation and brought i n supplies. But it was an experience Will does not want repeated, and as soon as possible he let go of his Texas holdings and moved to Washington County, Kansas. He says his crops this season were damaged, but that he raised enough to see him through the winter and he will enter upon his farm work with renewed energy and hope and expects to win out in the long run.","notes":"Article was pasted into FindAGrave.

The elder Clifton witnessed a deed there on April 5, 1766 between John Haws and Jacob Gidden. William served as a witness there on January 16, 1768 to a deed between Lewis Williams and William Jones. The children of John Clifton, Sr. were probably:\r\n\r\n(1) William, the subject,\r\n(2) Ezekial (R.S.), who married Sarah Blackshear and died in Jones County, North Carolina in 1792,\r\n(3) Richard (R.S.),\r\n(4) John, Jr. (R.S.), who married Penelope Ward,\r\n(5) Peter (R.S.), who died in Bertie County, North Carolina in 1788,\r\n(6) Levin, who settled in Beaufort County, South Carolina by 1790 and\r\n(7) Elizabeth, who became the wife of Benjamin Chambers.\r\n\r\nJohn Clifton, Sr. is believed to have died in Onslow County, North Carolina c1770 or not long thereafter.\r\n\r\nBy 1773, William Clifton, his brother John, Jr. and his sister Elizabeth removed north into Bertie County, North Carolina, where family tradition says they settled along the Roanoke River. Their brother Peter settled there as early as 1769 according to tax digests. William was married there on July 29, 1773 to Elizabeth Wheeler Hale, who may have been a young widow and a daughter of Henry Wheeler, a pioneer settler of that section.\r\n\r\nWilliam Clifton enlisted as a soldier in the Continental Army of North Carolina while a resident of the Warrenton District. It is believed he may have been the same individual by that name who enlisted on December 24, 1777 in Cook's 9th Regiment commanded by Colonel John Williams and served three years as a sergeant.\r\n\r\nAbout 1781, William, his wife and children, migrated to Georgia where they settled along the banks of the Great Ogeechee River at a place that later came to be known as \"Clifton's Ferry,\" south of Scarborough in present-day Jenkins County, but at that time a portion of Effingham County. William received a bounty grant for his land, which he surveyed himself on November 3, 1783, and which describes his property as 50 acres of \"corn land\" surrounded by pine timber and water oaks, located along the south side if the Great Ogeechee below Scull's Creek and one mile above the Ferry.\r\n\r\nWilliam Clifton was employed by the state of Georgia as a District Surveyor. Early land plat records of this region bear his name. He was later certified by Brigadier General Samuel Elbert as a patriot for the Whig cause during the American Revolution. He received several more bounty grants from the state of Georgia including 125 acres in Effingham County in 1785, 150 acres in Burke County in 1789 and yet another 225 acres in Effingham in 1789.\r\n\r\nTo William and Elizabeth Clifton were born the following children:\r\n\r\n| 1 | Ezekiel Clifton | b. 1773 | m. Elizabeth Roberts\r\n| 2 | John Clifton | b. 1774 | m. (1) Elizabeth Williams, (2) Eunice Stancil\r\n| 3 | William Clifton | b. 1776 | m. Sarah Coleman\r\n| 4 | Sarah Clifton | b. 1777 | m.

Rachel Jones\r\n\r\nThe original Clifton homeplace was located near the boundaries of the counties of Burke and Effingham and later Screven. The county lines have changed. several times throughout the course of history.\r\n\r\nWilliam Clifton, died about 1793. His remains were laid to rest on his property along the banks of the Great Ogeechee below Scarborough, Georgia.\r\n\r\nHis widow Elizabeth and their children continued residing at Clifton's Ferry for several years. She received a widow's bounty grant of 200 acres of pine land along the waters of House Creek on July 7, 1794, and yet another grant of 200 acres in Bulloch County in 1804.\r\n\r\nOn October 17, 1815, while a resident of Screven County, she deeded to her son Henry Clifton 100 acres of land upon which she lived as well as a feather bed and some furniture. She ordered 25 head of stock cattle to be divided amongst her sons.\r\n\r\nElizabeth Clifton died about 1826 and was buried beside her husband in the old family graveyard.

At the age of 4, he moved with his family from Virginia to St. George Parish, Georgia, which became Burke County in 1777. He died 7 October 1835 (173 years ago) in Tattnall County, Georgia. \r\nJeanette Holland Austin recorded in her book, Deaths of Revolutionary War Soldiers Who Died in Georgia and their Widows, that in Burke County about 1792, John Sharpe married Elizabeth “Betsey” Wynn, six years his senior. She was born in 1755 in Virginia and died 25 October 1835 in Tattnall County, Georgia, just 18 days after the death of her husband.\r\nJohn and Betsey had three children:\r\n1. John Thomas Sharpe, born 1 November 1795 in Burke County, Georgia\r\n2. Susan Elizabeth Sharpe, born 1800 in Burke County, Georgia\r\n3. Hamilton Wynn Sharpe, born 10 April 1807 in Tattnall County, Georgia\r\nJohn Sharpe moved in 1802 with his wife and their first two children to bounty land in Tattnall County that he received for his service in the Revolutionary War. Their third child was born in Tattnall County. \r\nJohn took an active part in the newly formed county and its government. He served two different terms as Sheriff; Justice of the Peace in the 43rd District of Tattnall County 1816-1818; and Major in the 10th Battalion Georgia Militia 1830-1834. As administrator of his father’s estate after 1806, he defended himself in court a number of times. He maintained a tavern of some sort, as several times he was granted license to sell liquor for 12 months. Several different times he was accused in court of wrongful activities. Sometimes he won the case - other times he lost.\r\nA death notice for John Sharpe was published in the Milledgeville, Georgia newspaper, The Southern Recorder, issue of 10 November 1835 as follows:\r\n“Another Revolutionary Patriot Gone! Died at his residence in Tattnall County on October 7th of bilious fever, Major John Sharpe in his 73rd year. At an early age he took up arms in defense of his country. In all his dealings, honesty and truth were strictly adhered to. He left an aged widow, but not for long as she died on 25th of October following. They had been married over 48 years. They leave behind two sons”.\r\nIn his book Sketches of By-Gone Days, Mr. Joseph T. Grice lists 44 names of Revolutionary Soldiers who made their homes in Tattnall County soon after its creation. He listed John Sharpe among them. Mr. Grice states of these men, “They made substantial contributions to the development of our county, many of them being large property owners and filling places of responsibility and trust among their fellows.\r\nAs their service to the Nation contributed to the winning of our war for independence, so did they contribute to the building of a good civilization here, and their descendants in the county today can well point with pride to the activities of their ancestors who came here in the long ago”.\r\nOn page one of Revolutionary Soldiers in Georgia, Volume III, Mrs. Howard H. McCall pays homage to our Patriot ancestors:\r\n“Many years have rolled away since the stirring scenes of the Revolution were acted, but the brilliant events of that period will live on the pages of history.\r\nThe names of those Revolutionary Soldiers, who espoused the popular cause and threw the whole weight of their power and influence on the side of Liberty, are on the Nation’s Roll of Honor.\r\nWhile the Revolutionary Army of Georgia was small compared to many other Colonies, it was our State, Georgia, which offered land in quantity as an inducement to Revolutionary Soldiers of all the States to settle in Georgia.\r\nTruly we can say these Revolutionary Soldiers from Georgia and the other Colonies helped to secure for us our glorious heritage.”\r\nBarbara Jo Mills Baker\r\n4th-Gr-Granddaughter of John Sharpe, Jr., R.S.\r\nOn the occasion of his Dedication of Revolutionary Soldier Grave Marker, Clifton Family Cemetery, Toombs County, Georgia.\r\n9 October 2008","story":"5d6d72e768047147208a1afb","stories":[],"tags":{},"fullTitle":"Second-hand Info - John Sharpe biography"},

He ran away from home at age 10, went to Denmark. He worked in a \"home bakery\" and undoubtedly that was where he learned to be a baker.[citation 1] He moved as a young man to Kristianstad, Malmö, later. Came back to Agunnaryd in 1879. He learned the bakery trade and changed his name during that time to Winblad. He moved from Agunnaryd to Pjätteryd 20 Sep 1879. Here he worked in the bakery till 26 Nov 1879. He married Clara Magnidotter on 30 Dec 1879. \r\nAnna and Wilhelm were born in Pjättaryd where Peter was a crofter (farm renter) and then a carpenter. Peter got the testimonials to move to northern Sweden 19 Apr 1884, but the family moved instead to Stockholm City. Here was born Carl. Peter emigrated from Stockholm via Götenberg to St. Paul on the ship Orlando on 25 May 1888. \r\nClara Magnidotter was born 19 Aug 1859 in Yxnäs, Sweden. She was the daughter of Magnus Esbjörnsson and Anna Stina Andersdotter in Yxnäs. She came from a poor stony part of Sweden and had to work very hard. She was also an orphan.[citation 2] She had a younger sister, Emma Marie born 29 Mar 1866. Clara's father died 23 Nov 1867; her mother 30 Oct 1869; Clara was only 10 years old – making she and her sister orphans – as Wilma said. It is not known what happened to them. They are listed on the Swedish household record of 1869 – 1876 by themselves. (Emma left Sweden from Stockholm 4 Jul 1894 going to Halifax. She left with 1 adult male named Anders Gustaf Kjellberg, her illegitimate son named Karl Gustaf born 3 Nov 1893 in Katarina Parish in Stockholm and a female foster child named Elvira Eleonora. On the Stockholm birth record for Elvira Eleonora there are no parents listed.)[citation 3] Clara went to work in Hjörtsborg parish in 1876 – 1877. At age 21 Clara came to the United States with children Anna, Wilhelm and Carl on 21 Sep 1888 on the ship Romeo. She was pregnant with twins, Esther and Esten. On the trip she had a very bad tooth ache. People on the ship thought the pain she was having was labor pains.[citation 4]\r\nThey came to Peter who was in St. Paul. From St. Paul to Freya, Wisconsin; then to Milaca. Peter was a baker and had a bakery in Milaca (see Appendix O). Peter was a small, jolly man and played the accordion.[citation 4] He lived with Clarence and Pearl Fix the last few years and died in their home.[citation 5] Clara died 24 Feb 1930; Peter August died of old age and cardiac failure 19 Jun 1939 (See Appendix P).\r\n[below: Citations included in the document]\r\n(1) Wilma Nyberg\r\n(2) Wilma Nyberg\r\n(3) Ann Wieck\r\n(4) Emily Skildum [sic: two of them labeled \"4\"]\r\n(4) Wilma Nyberg\r\n(5) Lois Fix Gravel","story":"5d616699e8d6b307246e41f1","stories":[],"tags":{},"fullTitle":"Nyberg Files - Peter August and Clara Winblad"},

The father and mother are natives of Norway have lived in America for nearly fifty years and are now residents of Parker, South Dakota.\r\nIn Mason City, Iowa, on November 27, 1870, Ben D. Martinson was born. In early childhood he moved with his parents to Council Bluffs, Iowa, lived with them four years in Kansas, and later in Minneapolis and in North and South Dakota, and finally returned to Iowa. The removals were necessitated by his father's occupation, that of railroading. The father later became a farmer in Wright county, Iowa, and was located near the town of Belmont. There Ben lived until after his twenty-second birthday, leaving home at that time to locate in Ruthton. For three years he was engaged in the well drilling business and then farmed in Aetna township until 1901. For seven years thereafter he was absent from Pipestone county, residing on his farm in Lincoln county. In 1908 Mr. Martinson returned to Ruthton and became the owner of the livery business he now successfully conducts.\r\nOn November 29, 1895, our subject was married to Alma Johnson, who was born in Winona, Minnesota, on May 16, 1877.

The neighbor, the late Judithun Day, walked to Jerseyville from Sugar Hollow in Otter Creek Township on his seventy-fifth anniversary. Members of Day's family followed him to town with a team and wagon but he repeatedly refused a ride with them and he walked the entire twenty-mile round trip. The incident made a deep and lasting impression on Vanausdoll who was just a boy but he vowed then that if he lived to mark his seventy-fifth anniversary and was physically able, he, too, would walk to Jerseyville.\r\nVanausdoll plans to leave his home in Dow at eight o'clock this morning and arrive here about ten thirty o'clock. He plans to visit a local drugstore for some ice cream and coffee before starting his trip home.\r\nWhen interviewed at his home last week by a representative of the Democrat-News, Mr. Vanausdoll related that when he was born seventy-five years ago the ground was covered with two inches of snow. He is the only living member of a family of thirteen children born to Caleb and Martha Hewitt Vanausdoll. He was born in Otter Creek Township and with the exception of two years spent in Madison County, has always resided in the southwestern part of Jersey County.\r\nHe is still active in his life-long trade of carpentry and painting and unlike \"the shoe cobbler with no shoes\" he has a nice six-room home which he built thirty-four years ago last spring and which he has kept in excellent condition. When visited at his home last week he was engaged in modernizing the kitchen.\r\nIn addition to his work Mr. Vanausdoll has found time to assist in community matters. He served as director for forty years in the schools of Dow, Diamond and Webster. He served one year as Tax Collector in Otter Creek Township, and was maintenance man on the state highway for three years.\r\nVanausdoll told the reporter of his conversion to the Methodist faith by \"little Mary Olive\" many years ago at a revival tent meeting. She is still engaged in revival work preaching throughout the country. He has served as Steward at the Bethel Methodist Church and for the past ten years has been a Bible Class teacher. During the past decade he has missed only seven Sabbath school sessions.\r\nOf small stature the seventy-five year old man is exceptionally active. He recalled only three periods of ill health in his three-quarter century of life, the most disabling of which was an attack of arthritis suffered about a year ago this time. He was unable to work from November 1, 1948, until May, 1949, but his condition now [text not visible].\r\nVanausdoll, who had two ancestors who lived to near the century mark, is now setting his goal for his one hundredth birthday. His grandfather, John Vanausdoll, reached the age of ninety-eight years, and an uncle, Allen Vanausdoll, was ninety-seven years old at the time of his death. The latter operated a grocery store in Jerseyville for a number of years.\r\nMr. Vanausdoll is the father of thirteen children, ten of whom are still living. Five children were born to Mr. Vanausdoll and his first wife, Rachel Gilmore, whose death occurred a few weeks after the birth of her fifth child. The children of this union were Mrs. Florence[?] [?] of [?], Missouri, Mrs. Lucille Josias of Wellston, Theodore Vanausdoll of St. Louis, and Mrs. Edna Ferguson and Glenn Vanausdoll, deceased. He later married Christine Schaaf and they are the parents of Mrs. Hazel Hunt and Mrs. Irene Yates of Alton, Mrs. John Vinckier of St. Louis, Mrs. Alice Warren of Cottage Hills, Miss Martha Vanausdoll of Wellston, Everett and Herbert Vanausdoll of Dow, and Virgil Vanausdoll, deceased. The latter was killed in a bus accident seven years ago when he was a first year student at the local high school. Vanausdoll has ten grandchildren.","notes":"Uploaded to Ancestry.com by me.","summary":"Inspired by his neighbor Jeduthan Day (incidentally, his sister's father-in-law) many years ago, James Vanausdoll plans to walk 15 miles to town to celebrate his 75th birthday.","story":"5d5c9ab229bff1eebac5b770","stories":[],"tags":{"biography":true},"fullTitle":"Unknown Newspaper - James Vanausdoll birthday walk"},

Sheldon P. Smith, 96 years old, the last living member of the Georgia legislature of 1864 and 1865 which was forced to adjourn and move on account of the approaching Union army, died Sunday afternoon at the home of his eldest son, Joseph Smith. of Hilliard, Fla., and interment was held this afternoon at his home at Perry's Mill in the southern part of Toombs county.\r\nMr. Smith came to this county in 1832 while only 17 months old from Pawtucket, R. I. His father, Nicholas Smith, had operated a store in Mount Vernon, Ga., from 1824 until 1828 when he bought Perry's Mill from his brother, Moses Smith, in 1828, then moved his family to Georgia four years later.\r\nSheldon Smith was a classmate of Major Charlie Hardee, treasurer of Savannah, during their school days for five years at Bradwell institute at Hinesville, from 1843 to 1848. An attempt was made during the last legislature to memorialize him by the representative of Toombs county, Dess Gray, but the records of the capitol did not give the exact date of his service. He was formerly ordinary of Toombs county, and has been active in the political and community welfare of the county during his entire life. Up to a year and a half ago when he suffered a stroke he could remember all the boundary lines of property over the major portion of the county, having an extremely keen memory. For 40 years he was postmaster at Perry's Mill, in the edge of Tattnall county, and was justice of the peace for 60 years.\r\nIn 1853 he married Miss Frances Elizabeth Bell, of Tattnall county. Thirteen children were born to this union of which 6 still live. Mrs. Smith died in 1907. The surviving children are Joseph P. Smith, Of Hilliard, Fla.; S. P. Smith, Jr., of Damascus, Ga.; Allen J. Smith, of Macon; Mrs. Haralson Clifton, of Toombs county; Mrs. John Ash Pearson, of Savannah, and Miss Belle Smith, of Damascus. He has 97 living grandchildren, great and great-great-grandchildren.","story":"5d5c9bec87c703eee7ee7f8d","stories":[],"tags":{},"fullTitle":"The Atlanta Constitution - Sheldon P. Smith obituary"},

The official death count was 418; the actual number of fatalities was likely higher.\r\nAfter a two-month summer drought, combined with very high temperatures, several small fires started in the pine forests of Pine County, Minnesota. The fires' spread apparently was due to the then-common method of lumber harvesting, wherein trees were stripped of their branches in place; these branches littered the ground with flammable debris. Also contributing was a temperature inversion that trapped the gases from the fires. The scattered blazes united into a firestorm. The temperature rose to at least 2,000 °F (1,100 °C). Barrels of nails melted into one mass, and in the yards of the Eastern Minnesota Railroad, the wheels of the cars fused with the rails. Some residents escaped by climbing into wells, ponds, or the Grindstone River. Others clambered aboard two crowded trains that pulled out of the threatened town minutes ahead of the fire.\r\nJames Root, an engineer on a train heading south from Duluth, rescued nearly 300 people by backing up a train nearly five miles to Skunk Lake, where the passengers escaped the fire. William Best was an engineer on a train sent specifically to evacuate people...\r\nThe fire destroyed the town of Hinckley (which at the time had a population of over 1,400) as well as the smaller nearby settlements of Mission Creek, Brook Park, Sandstone, Miller, Partridge and Pokegama.\r\nThe exact number of fatalities is difficult to determine. The official coroner's report counted 413 dead while the fire's official monument notes 418. An unknown number of Native Americans and backcountry dwellers were also killed in the fire; bodies continued to be found years later. Along with the 1918 Cloquet Fire (where 453 were killed) it is one of the deadliest in Minnesota history.","story":"5d6d68768e0c46466966d378","stories":["5d58dd6a8a5ebab1c5fe5d37"],"tags":{},"fullTitle":"Wikipedia - Great Hinckley Fire"},

One of the pleasures he told his children about was going with the boats to harvest oysters and eating them \"very fresh out of the shell\". He stayed there long enough to become very sympathetic with Southern ideas.\r\nOn August 14, 1848, he married a cute little Irish girl, Mary Grimes. Five children arrived but two were lost a month apart in 1858. He took his family to Illinois probably about 1859 by boat up the Mississippi river. The river was important in my father's memory. John arrived in July of 1860. A 160-acre timber farm was for sale near Grafton so it was purchased. Jeduthan was a fine carpenter like his father so he too found work, but frequently far from home. His two oldest sons had to assume home responsibilities far too soon. \"Going west\" was still important, so he moved his family to Humboldt, Nebraska.\r\nFort Riley, Kansas, was started in 1853-54 and enlarged in 1886-87. Jeduthan found this a good place for steady employment.\r\nFifty years after he left he returned to his old home place in New Jersey in 1887 after Elias, his older brother made an extended search for him. He died at the home of Silas on February 25, 1896 of cancer and is buried at Table Rock cemetery.","story":"5d5cac4faefc90ef13d819db","stories":[],"tags":{"biography":true},"fullTitle":"The Lives of Our Days - Jeduthan Day biography"},

Ordinarily, these ruins are completely covered by high water.\r\nHowever, in the Fall of 1964, after summer's long drought, archaeologists from the North Jersey Highlands Historical Society, Edward J. Lenik and James Norman, decided to explore the almost dry reservoir. Their immediate objective was to examine a cam ring and anvil base, clues to the early existence of a forge, which had been discovered earlier by Norman while he was searching for Indian arrowheads.\r\nThe men walked to the center of the reservoir, following an old road bed clearly in evidence along the dry bottom. As they approached the spot, they began to realize that it possessed an abundance of two principal requirements for iron manufacture: power from the stream and fuel from the forest.\r\nLying across the stream was a dam, approximately 10 feet high and 10 feet wide, constructed entirely out of slag. This dam had produced a good sized pond so necessary to supply the power required in the smelting process.\r\nThe spillway was ripped out, probably during the construction of the reservoir. However, several hugh timbers and boards were visible in a good state of preservation. A few feet down from the dam, the men found the anvil base, and after carefully scraping soil from it, discovered that it was cradled in heavy wooden beams. These wooden beams had helped to absorb the shock of the hammer as it fell on the anvil.\r\nOther discoveries at the site were a beautiful cut stone wall about three feet high, and adjacent to it the foundation of a building. Near the foundation the men found the cam ring lying in the mud. (In the operation of the bloomery, this cam ring was fastened to a waterwheel shaft which raised the giant hammer as it turned). Slag \"clinkers\", charcoal, plate iron of various sizes, nails, and spikes littered the entire area.\r\nAmong the artifacts the men picked up were six white clay pipe stem fragments and one pipe bowl. According to Lenik, all of the stems came from pipes made in England. One of them bore the initials of the maker, \"C. P.\" The red clay pipe bowl, molded in ribbed style decoration, was probably of American manufacture, dating the early 19th century.\r\nLenik explains the operation of this early ironworks as follows:\r\n\"The most essential feature of a bloomery was the fact that it was a forge operation which made wrought iron directly from the ore. The bloomery was very similar to a blacksmith's forge, except that the hearth was larger and the sides deeper.\r\n\"In operation, the hearth was first heated for four to five hours by keeping it two-thirds full of lighted charcoal. The fuel was then pushed up against the air blast inlet and sloped down towards the opposite side. Upon this bed of hot coals was placed iron ore, flux, and charcoal, and the air blast was gradually applied.\r\n\"The iron was now slowly worked with a bar to allow the air current to come into contact with all parts of the mass which was called the 'loop'. The loop, contained many impurities.\r\n\"This mass was then lifted out, and subjected to the blows of a heavy hammer which removed some of the foreign matter. The hammer consisted of an iron block weighing approximately 500 to 600 pounds which was fastened to one end of a wooden beam so that it had free up and down movement. This beam, held in great wooden legs, was raised by cams on the waterwheel shaft. After the hammer was raised, it was allowed to fall by gravity on an anvil. The semi-molten iron was placed on this anvil and subjected to successive blows until the desired shape and size was obtained.\r\nInformation relating to the establishment and operation of the Canistear Bloomery is meager. Charles S. Boyer, in his \"Early Forges and Furnaces in New Jersey,\" published in 1868, says it was started in 1796, and was at one time operated by Adam Smith and the Day brothers. Another source, \"The Geological Survey of New Jersey\" for 1910 confirms the year without comment. According to a map of Sussex County published in 1860, the bloomery was apparently in operation in that year. The map also notes the names of families living in the area among which are A. Smith and C. D. Day.\r\nThe Day brothers, Silas and De Witt, were quite active in iron manufacture in the area. in 1803, the brothers purchased and operated the Herring Bone Forge in Stockholm. Later, De Witt withdrew from the partnership and took over operation of the Canistear Bloomery.\r\nIn regard to Adam Smith, one writer in the year 1881, describes Smith as the most \"venerable\" resident of Canistear who has nearly reached his 90th year, and who still preserves his mental vigor to a remarkable degree. He goes on to describe Canistear as \"a mere settlement, located in the southeast corner of the township, the pioneer of which was Adam Smith.\r\n\"At an early day, an extensive forge was located here, and water power of considerable magnitude was fed by a series of ponds lying to the northward. The iron mine, for some time worked, is now dormant. No trace of enterprise remains in the hamlet.\"","story":"5db5fbadcf6405834670f5d7","stories":["5db5fb58cf6405834670f5d6"],"tags":{},"fullTitle":"The Herald-News - Canistear Bloomery rediscovered"},

My father seldom mentioned either his father or his mother--for exactly opposite reasons--and the older grandchildren who still survive seem to remember \"Grandpa Day\" chiefly as a man of violent and unreasoning temper, which, apparently, he never made much effort to control. I have gleaned a few facts regarding him from some writings of my father, entitled \"Recollections of my Early Life,\" and the quotations which follow are from that source.\r\n\r\nSilas Day was born and brought up at Morristown, New Jersey, a town of considerable culture and import&ie even in those times. \"His father was an intelligent and well-to-do farmer, owning a large and unencumbered farm in the edge of town.\" Brought up in such favorable surroundings, Silas was evidently a young man of promise when he married, at the age of twenty, Susan Breese, a young woman of much intelligence, refinement, and education. \"His father was proud of him, and proud of his young wife, and, having plenty of money, he concluded to set him up in business. He chose a business neither of them knew anything about, and the result was a disastrous failure.\"\r\n\r\nThe business referred to was that of iron-making. The mountains of Northern New Jersey abound in deposits of iron ore, and in the early part of the last century, iron-making was the principal industry, the abundant forests supplying great quantities of charcoal, a fuel needed for smelting and refining the ore. A forge was purchased for young Silas and his brother DeWint, within the boundaries of what is now the town of Stockholm, New Jersey, on the banks of the Pequannock River, at the junction of the main road with the lowest of the four roads which now lead from Stockholm to the village of Holland. This forge bore the name of \"Herring Bone Forge,\" due, it is said, to the bones of herring fish cast away at lunch time by the workmen employed there. DeWint soon withdrew from the partnership, to operate a forge of his own at Canistear. The subsequent failure of Silas was a natural consequence of his lack of experience in the iron business. He was overwhelmed by debts and pursued by the constable, who would come every little while and levy on his household goods and sell them at constable sale.\r\n\r\n\"In those times there was no two-hundred-dollar exemption law. A few articles of household furniture were exempt - as six knives, six forks, two beds and bedding, six chairs, one table, one pot, one pail, and so on. I can't remember the whole schedule, but it was short - just a few of the absolutely necessary articles for housekeeping. Imagine what would be left after four or five constable sales, with a short interval between each! It was a law in those days that if a creditor could not obtain satisfaction for his debt by the sale of the goods and chattels of the debtor, he could obtain execution against the body of his debtor and have him imprisoned in the county jail, until the debt was paid or the prisoner discharged through the operation of the insolvent law then in force.\r\n\r\n\"After five or six constable sales, which, as can be imagined, never paid much on the original debts, my father was sent to jail at Hackensack. He was finally released, when the laws authorizing imprisonment for debt were repealed.\" \r\n\r\nDuring these years of struggle and privation and abject poverty, a large family had come into existence--eleven children in all, of whom three died in childhood. My grandfather, instead of sharing the noble spirit of his wife, made her lot harder by throwing upon her for one whole year the entire burden of this large family. After the iron business failed, he became a travelling clock mender, and it was during one of these trips that he disappeared from the knowledge of his family. Grandmother bore her sorrow without complaint, and did her best, with the aid of the older boys, to care for her family. One day a cousin who was calling upon her chanced to look out of the window and exclaimed: \"Why there's Silas!\" The revulsion of feeling was too great and Grandmother fainted. \r\n\r\nIn appearance, Grandfather was short and stout, with clean shaven face and high forehead. He was fond of a good joke, but , as I have intimated, had a hasty and ungovernable temper, and was very bitter in his denunciation of the shortcomings of Christians. In early life, prior to his marriage, he was an active member and class leader in the Methodist church, but in later years he lost his faith and developed atheistical tendencies. He attributed this change to the hypocrisy of a certain preacher, who once wronged him in some business transaction and whom he never forgave. \r\n\r\nDespite the fact of his early failure in business, for which he was really not to blame, my grandfather was always strictly honest in his business relations. Considering the intemperate times in which he lived, and his self-indulgent and undisciplined nature, it is remarkable that he was a total abstainer from both liquor and tobacco, and had much to say against their use by others. He has transmitted to nearly all of his male descendants a strong distaste for both these forms of dissipation, so that, since his time, there have been few smokers among them and so far as my knowledge extends, no drinkers. Grandfather seemed to be fond of children, especially of his grandchildren, my brother, Edgar, being one of his favorites. The following anecdote would seem to indicate that he was not wholly lacking in tenderness toward his own children: When my father was about ten years old, the family spent a year in Basking Ridge, New Jersey, living in a little cottage near the residence of Grandmother's brother, John Breese. They returned to Sussex County the following spring, traveling, of course, by team, as there were no railroads then. The streams were swollen by copious rains, and at one point on the route a bridge had been washed away, and it was necessary to ford the river. The wagon was upset in the water and the baby fell beneath it, being rescued just in time to save the little life. Forty years later, when relating the incident, my grandfather wept. \r\n\r\nGrandfather lived in at least four houses in Northern New Jersey, only one of which is standing at the present time. A little log house on the top of Paradise Hill was the birthplace of my father and was the family home for a number of years, though I am unable to say for how long. A still more tiny log house, in the depths of the forest near Buckbear Mountain, was occupied by the family for a short time. It was known as the \"Morgan House.\" \r\n\r\nA later, more comfortable home was at Stockholm, in a two-story frame house which still stands at the junction of the main road with the road leading under the railroad bridge to Canistear. (Of course, neither the bridge nor the railroad were there in Grandfather's time.) \r\n\r\nIt is thought to have been this house which sheltered the mother and the children during the dark days of the year when the head of the family was missing. In all probability, it was while the family were living here, that the three older children, Phebe, Susan, and Elias, married and went their several ways. Jeduthan, the second son, must have gone away from home at about the same time. He left his native state and went to grow up with the Great West, but, at the time, no one knew where he had gone, and for many years he was completely lost to his family. Neither of his parents ever saw him again, and his mother, at least, never knew what became of him. Years afterward, Uncle Elias caused a systematic search to be made for the wanderer, and he was finally located at Grafton, Illinois, where he was living with a wife and five children. In 1887, fifty years after his departure from New Jersey, Uncle Jeduthan returned for the first time to visit his brothers and sister in the East. \r\n\r\nMy father married in 1846 and brought his young wife to live under the family roof for a year or so, while their own house on Paradise hill was in the process of erection. \r\n\r\nIt was in the Stockholm house, on July 28, 1847, that Grandmother died. Three years later Grandfather brought home a second wife, who had been Miss Margaret Mortimer. She was a good, capable woman, respected by all, but her marriage with Grandfather was an evident mistake and never brought her much happiness. After all the children had left home, Grandpa and \"Grandma Maggie,\" as she came to be known, lived alone for a time in the lower part of the Stockholm house. My brother Frank remembers going down there from Paradise, at frequent intervals, to chop wood for them and do other necessary chores. I am unable to say just when they left Stockholm, but it is known that they lived for a time with Grandpa's oldest daughter, Mrs. Phebe Grimstead, whose home was near New Brunswick, New Jersey.\r\n\r\nThe property on the top of Paradise Hill had remained in the possession of the family, and when my father married, he built for himself a substantial and comfortable two-story frame house on the Hill, a short distance from the original log cabin, which had crumbled to decay. My parents moved into this house soon after their marriage. Some fourteen or fifteen years later, my grandfather came, in his old age, to spend his last days with them. The infirmities of age gradually increased upon him, and during the last year or more, he was nearly helpless as a paralytic. His care was a great tax upon my mother's strength and helped to break down her health. His mind failed, though, in the midst of much mental darkness, there were sometimes flashes of intelligence. During one of these, my sister Susie remembers seeing him reading the New Testament, and hearing him say, with tears streaming down his face: \"I would be willing to spend eternity in toil and hardship, if it would purchase for me a place in heaven beside Susan!\" (I give only the substance of this pitiful lament: my sister has forgotten the exact words). He seemed to entirely forget the existence of his second wife, and remembered on the wife of his youth, often calling my mother \"Susan.\" He died on April 5, 1867, and sleeps beside \"Susan\" in the little country churchyard at Oak Ridge, their graves marked by a common stone. \r\n\r\nMarch 1. 1913. \r\n\r\n[below: Image caption]\r\nThe Day family of Morristown, N.J., in the 1870's.

Now West Milford has become a thriving municipality on its own, and the long narrow lake is narrowing in relative importance to the status of an \"added attraction.\"\r\nOnce it played an instrumental role in the early development of North Jersey and later, of West Milford.\r\nHere, then, is a panoramic review sketching the township's origins, early settlers, and their shaping of a community from the wilderness.\r\n...\r\nEarly family names in the Newfoundland, Paradise, and Oak Ridge sections included Kanouse, Brown, Kemble, Stickle, Bigelow, Day, Norman, and Post. Here was how they put down roots:\r\n...\r\nThe Day family came to Newark from Milford, Conn., in 1667 and are believed to have been part of a group of Puritans who negotiated with the Hackensack Indians for a tract of land upon which the group settled. The land was first called Pesayak Towne, later New Milford, and then Newark.\r\nSilas Day, born July 23, 1783, and died April 5, 1867, operated a forge with his brother, DeWitt, in the area now known as the town of Stockholm. It became known as \"Herring Bone Forge\", due, it is said, to the many bones of herring fish cast away at lunchtime by the works. DeWitt Day later withdrew from the partnership and operated a forge of his own at Canistear.\r\nEdgar Arthur Day, a descendant of Silas, who was principal of a public school in Jersey City and a physician and surgeon in Brooklyn, later returned to Newfoundland where he founded the sanitarium on Union Valley Rd., still known today as \"Idylease Inn\". Day died there May 15, 1906, and was buried with many of his ancestors at Oak Ridge.\r\n...","story":"5db6147a3d27820595c5b89b","stories":["5db5fb58cf6405834670f5d6","5db61f413d27820595c5b8ae"],"tags":{},"fullTitle":"The News - West Milford Roots"},

The only surviving example of resort facilities in the region, it recalls the popularity of the region as the vacationland for the middle class in the late nineteenth century. The Inn was built for a group of 11 investors calling themselves The Newfoundland Health Association headed by Dr Edgar Day from Brooklyn, NY. Idylease is situated on the summit of an 1,000-foot (300 m)-hill in the foothills of the Ramapo Mountains and is located 30 miles northwest from New York City.\r\n\r\nHistory\r\nWork began on Idylease in summer of 1900 and opened its doors on New Year's Day in 1902. Architecturally, Idylease Inn embodies a variety of distinctive characteristics commonly associated with this type of resort architecture in this region at the turn of the century. On the exterior the most salient features associated with this type are the broad veranda and second story balcony which deteriorated and was removed sometime during the 1930s. Expansive porches and open air-balconies were an essential feature of the resort hotel, providing guests with vistas of the surrounding wilderness and pleasant public spaces for social gatherings. Verandas also served as sanitary and therapeutic retreats from which to enjoy the \"healthful and moral atmosphere of nature, reflecting the popularity of resorts not only for pleasure and recreational activity but also for escapes from the crowded, disease ridden and immoral conditions of the suddenly industrialized cities of the northeast.\"\r\n\r\nThe Newfoundland Health Association\r\nDr. Day founded The Newfoundland Village Improvement Society in 1902 which was formed to \"protect the interest of the residents and property holders of Newfoundland, New Jersey improve the conditions of the roads, secure better railroad service, and in general do whatever shall tend to increase the beauty and attractiveness of our village and its surroundings.\" Dr Day remained president of the society until his death at Idylease in 1906. Dr. Daniel Drake who was the resident physician and general manager of Idylease at the time of Dr. Days death became the principal stock holder of the Newfoundland Health Association which owned Idylease. George A. Day, Dr. Drakes brother was appointed assistant manager.\r\n\r\nNoted guests\r\nThomas Edison was a regular guest of Idylease while working on a magnetic ore extracting device at the Franklin/Odgensberg Mine for the New Jersey Zinc Company. F. Fichter Hoagan, a longtime business manager to previous owner Dr. Daniel Drake often reminisced of the days when \"Mr. Edison would stay overnight at Idylease while traveling to the mine. Newfoundland marked the half way point from Edison’s laboratories in East Orange. He would spend the night at Idylease and have his car serviced at the local garage\". Edison was no stranger to the area. He had filmed scenes from The Great Train Robbery (film) in Echo Lake and was known to fish along the banks of the Pequannock River.","story":"5d6d68768e0c46466966d378","stories":["5db61f413d27820595c5b8ae"],"tags":{},"fullTitle":"Wikipedia - Idylease Inn"},
