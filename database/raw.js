Sheldon","__v":0,"content":"Sheldon, James R., is numbered among the prominent business men and influential citizens of Savannah and is a veteran of the Civil war in which he served as a member of a Georgia regiment. He is a representative of stanch colonial stock in both the paternal and maternal lines.\r\nHe was born in Pawtuxet near the city of Providence, RI, June 2, 1840, a son of Capt. Pardon and Rebecca (Aborn) Sheldon, who were likewise natives of Pawtuxet. The father was born in 1801 and his death occurred in 1849. He was a ship owner and sea captain and his death occurred when the subject of this sketch was about eight years of age Captain Sheldon was a son of Remington and Huldah Greene Sheldon the former born in 1753 and died in 1829 and the latter born in 1758 and died in 1822 having been a representative of the same family of which Gen Nathaniel Greene of Revolutionary fame was a distinguished member Rebecca Aborn Sheldon was born in 1806 and died in 1869 She was a daughter of Jonathan and Dorcas Tourtellot Aborn the former born in 1778 and died in 1826 and the latter was born in 1774 and died in 1850.\r\nJames R. Sheldon attended the schools of his native village until he attained to the age of fourteen years and has been dependent upon his own resources from early youth. He came to the state of Georgia in 1858 and went forth from this state to lend his aid in defending the cause of the Confederacy On March 2 1862 he enlisted as a private in Company E Fiftieth Georgia infantry and soon afterward proceeded with his command to reinforce Lee's army below the city of Richmond Va taking part in the engagement at Malvern Hill and in all the later engagements in which Longstreet's corps was involved Mr Sheldon never asked or received a furlough nor was he absent from duty at any time continuing in service until the close of the war. He was a non commissioned officer until after the battle of Fredericksburg when he was promoted commissary of his regiment succeeding Capt SM Colding who was transferred to post duty in Savannah For six months he served as commissary of the brigade commanded by Generals Benning and Bryan receiving the rank of major and succeeding Major Hankel who was transferred to Charleston SC He remained on duty until the great conflict terminated with the surrender of General Lee at Appomattox Va his regiment having been captured on Sailor's creek Va on April 6 1865 three days before Lee's capitulation Major Sheldon managed to escape at the time of his regiment's surrender and then made his way on foot to Georgia Soon afterward he went to Florida and from Oct 1 1865 until the same relative date of the following year he held a clerical position at Madison that state. He then returned to Georgia and located in Savannah where he was in the employ of a commission house until 1870 when he engaged in the cotton commission business on his own account In 1880 he was one of the three organizers of the Savannah Guano Company erecting a plant on the east side of the city and eventually building up an important and prosperous enterprise the scope of the industry being such that a number of enlargements have been made on the plant from time to time He has been vice president of the company from the start and has capitalistic interests in the city which has been his home for two score of years In politics Mr Sheldon maintains an independent attitude giving his support to the men and measures meeting the approval of his judgment. He has served as a member of the board of aldermen of Savannah and was a member of the city health and sanitary board for about six years. He is identified with the United Confederate Veterans; served for about six years on the staff of Gen. Clement A. Evans commander of the order in Georgia and is now assistant adjutant general on the staff of General Willy. He is also identified with the Savannah Volunteer Guards and the Oglethorpe club. He is not a member of any religious organization but attends the services of St John's church Protestant Episcopal of which Mrs Sheldon is a communicant. He has advanced to the fourteenth degree of Scottish Rite Masonry and takes a deep interest in the time honored fraternity On April 7 1875 Major Sheldon was united in marriage to Miss Louisa C Roberts daughter of Hiram and Mary J. Roberts of Savannah. Mrs. Sheldon died in 1881 and on Nov 16 1882 he married her sister Miss Bessie Roberts. Their only child is James R., Jr., who was born on Nov. 5, 1893."},

Clifton","__v":0,"content":"CLIFTON, John H., planter, Lyons, Tattnall Co., Ga, son of William and Susan (Sharpe) Clifton, was born in Tattnall county, March 12,1839.\r\nHis grandfather on his father's side was Ezekiel Clifton, who, when a young man, came from Roanoke county, N.C., and was among the early settlers in this part of southeastern Georgia. He married Miss Elizabeth Roberts, a native of Screven county, Ga., and engaged in stock raising.\r\nWilliam Clifton, father of the subject of this sketch, also made a life pursuit of farming and stock raising, but having developed under the instruction of Christopher Bowland, the famous Irish mathematician, unusual mathematical ability, made an enviable reputation as a surveyor. He was employed by the United States government to survey portions of the Cherokee country in north Georgia, and was very highly complimented by the then governor of the state for the excellence of his work. He served at various times as clerk of the court and as a justice of the inferior court, and represented the county in the general assembly. He died Dec 21,1873. His widow, born Feb. 1,1820, still survives, and is living on the old homestead in the southern part of Tattnall county.\r\nHis grandfather on his mother's side, Maj. John T. Sharpe, was the son of a soldier in the revolutionary war, a prosperous farmer and a prominent politician, having represented the county several times in the general assembly.\r\nMr. Clifton's parents reared to maturity nine children, seven of whom are now living: Maria, born April 22, 1837, married Dr. John Rambo, of South Carolina, who spent the latter part of his life in Georgia and died at Valdosta. He was a surveyor in the Confederate army. They had one child, Willie, who is a teacher in Tattnall county. Mrs. Rambo died March 14. 1862; John H, the subject of this sketch; Harrison, born April 12,1841, farmer, Tattnall county, married Miss Fannie Smith, has nine children; Thomas, born April 6, 1843, farmer, Tattnall county, married Miss Sallie Shepard, of Liberty county, Ga., has eight children, has represented the second senatorial district in the general assembly; Elizabeth, born April 5,1845, married Capt. S.D. Bradwell; Ezekiel, born Dec.,7 (no year given here), farmer, Tattnall county, married Miss Viola Brannan, of Bulloch county, has had six children; Emma, born March 2, 1852, married John Diestel, born in Hamburg, Germany, now farmer, Tattnall county, has three children; William, born June 29,1854, married Miss Helen Raymond, North Lyme, Conn., who died without issue, and he married Miss Wilhelmina A. Hilton, of McIntosh county, one child. He is a prominent lawyer in Savannah, Ga., and has represented Chatham county two terms in the general assembly; Benjamin Hill, born Aug. 9,1856, died Oct. 19, 1890.\r\nMr. Clifton was educated in the common schools of the country. He enlisted (as did his brothers Thomas and Harrison) in Company G, Fifth Georgia cavalry, state troops. The command was with Gen. Johnson’s forces, and participated in the battles at Kennesaw Mountain, around and at Atlanta, Nashville, and at Bentonville, N.C., remaining in the army until the surrender. After the war he engaged in farming, and to a limited extent in the manufacture of naval stores. He represented the second senatorial district in the general assembly four years before the adoption of the constitution of 1877, and was elected to represent the same district in the first election held after its adoption. He was in the senate during the celebrated impeachment trial of Goldsmith and Renfroe, etc. These continued honors indicate a popularity and public confidence quite rare, and undoubtedly gratifying to the recipient. Mr. Clifton was married April 19,1883, to Miss Amanda Coursey, born Aug. 13,1868, daughter of T. J. Coursey, of Montgomery county, Ga. To them six children have been born; Olivia Robie, born Aug. 28,1884; William Clisby, born March 6, 1886; Minnie Lou, born March 16, 1888; Benjamin Hill, born Feb. 8, 1890; Susan, born Feb. 21(no year is given here), died Dec. 27, 1892, and Minis Hunter, born April 14, 1894. Mr. Clifton is quietly enjoying the pleasures and comforts of a well-spent life, and a bright and lovely family circle at his home in the western part of the county."},

The family were among the early settlers of Rhode Island. Mr. Smith's father was born March 11,1787, and his mother July 23,1798. When Mr. Smith was about a year old (1832) his parents migrated to Georgia and settled in Tattnall county, where his father engaged in merchandising. They had eight children, of whom Mr. Smith was the fourth, five of whom are now living. Mr. Smith was given the best education the schools of the county afforded, and then was sent to Hinesville (Liberty county, Ga) high school, at that time in charge of Prof. Bradwell, father of Hon. S. D. Bradwell, the late able state school commissioner. He succeeded his father in his mercantile business, and has also been engaged in farming. About 1861 he was elected justice of the peace and notary public in the district since. Just after the war he was appointed postmaster at Perry's Mills, and has held the office from that time until now. He was not in active service during the war, but he represented Tattnall county (1863-65) in the general assembly.

Sharpe","__v":0,"content":"SHARPE, Robert M., physician and surgeon, Perry's Mills, Tattnall Co., Ga., son of John T. and Rebecca (Lasseter) Sharpe, was born Nov. 20, 1836. His grandfather, John Sharpe, was a soldier in the revolutionary army, and came with his family from Halifax county, Va., to Georgia, early in this century, and settled in Burke county. Dr. Sharpe’s father was born Nov. 1,1795, and followed farming in Burke county. His wife was born in Burke county March 29,1795, and to them eight children were born, the doctor being the youngest, and of them four sons are now living: E.F., Kissimmee City, Fla.; John T., farmer, Tattnall county; Henry R., farmer, Lowndes county, and Robert M., the subject of this sketch. Dr. Sharpe was educated at the county common schools, attended Burke county high school two years and then attended school one year in Princess Anne county, Va. With this preliminary preparation he entered the medical college of Georgia, Augusta, and was graduated in 1859, receiving his diploma from Hon. Ebenezer Starnes, president. He located at once in Tattnall county, but before he got fairly started the unpleasantness occurred, and he enlisted in the army. Considering afterward that he could be of more service at home among the people, he placed a substitute and practiced in the county during the war, there being only one other physician in the county. With the exception of three years-1869-1871, when he practiced in Lowndes county-he has continuously practiced in Tattnall county. He has been successful, has the confidence and esteem of the people and enjoys an extensive practice. Dr. Sharpe, was married Feb. 16,1858, to Miss Mary J. Kennedy, born March 28,1841, daughter of Robert Kennedy, of Webster (originally from Monroe) county, Ga. This union was blessed with ten children, all living but the first-born, who died in infancy. They are as follows: Susan, born Aug. 26,1860, married John Davis, Tattnall county, and they have five children: Thomas R., born Oct. 2, 1862, married Miss Luray Smith, and they have one child; Roberta A., born Aug. 6,1865, married Jesse H. Little, of North Carolina, but now living in Tattnall county, and has four children; Anna, born April 28,1868, married D. Armistead, Screven county; Claudius M., born Oct. 26,1870, married Eliza Johnson, of Appling county, Ga., now living in Florida; Francis L., born Feb. 24,1873; John H., born May 15, 1875; Emma L., born Dec. 19,1877, and Robert M., Jr., born April 17,1888. Possessing a fine estate, a competency, with an excellent practice that keeps him actively employed, and surrounded by his interesting family. Dr. Sharpe needs nothing to make life entirely enjoyable."},

Before lapsing into unconsciousness Mr. Olsen stated that when he started down the stairs he felt dizzy and sat down when things turned dark and he remembered no more. From this it is presumed that he suffered a slight stroke of apoplexy and while in this condition, rolled to the bottom. The injury to the head causing a blood clot.\r\nMr. Olsen has been a resident of this section for many years and was a neighbor well thought of and beloved by all, and his unexpected death was a shock to the entire community.\r\nChristian Olsen was born in Denmark in 1854 and when 28 years of age, with his wife and four children came to this country settling in Racine, Wisc., moving to this neighborhood in 1891 where he has since resided.\r\nThe funeral services were held at the Danish Lutheran church Tuesday after- noon at 3 o'clock. Rev. Pedersen conducts the last sad rites. The church was filled to overflowing by old neighbors and friends who followed the remains to the cemetery where the last respects were paid.\r\nThe deceased, for years, had been a member of the local Woodmen, and a part of the membership attended in a body out of respect for their departed brother and gave the Woodman honors at the grave.\r\nNine children are left to mourn the loss of a beloved father, they being Lena who resides at Doran, Marie, of Minneapolis, Tina, of Russell, Christina, who is a resident of Denmark, and Maggie, Lizzie, Peter, Nels and Chris, of Ruthton, who were in attendance with the exception of Chris who is in the Navy and could not be reached.

SHELDON PERKINS SMITH.\r\nWhen someone speaks of the grand old man of Lyons and Toombs County it is only the stranger in that community who has to be informed that reference is made to the venerable judge of the Probate Court, Sheldon Perkins Smith. Now nearly eighty-five years of age, practically his entire life has been one of unselfish service and devotion to his fellow men and his home community. It is common report in Toombs County that Judge Smith, as a result of his impulsive and broad-minded generosity, has given away a fortune. In fact he has apparently found his chief pleasure in helping those that needed help, regardless of politics, religion or creed. It would be difficult to conceive a higher degree of esteem than that paid by his fellow citizens to this fine old citizen of Lyons.\r\nBorn in the State of Rhode Island June 27, 1831, Judge Smith is a son of Nicholas Peck and Urania (Turtelott) Smith. America has been the home of this branch of the Smith family for about two centuries. The immigrant ancestor was Christopher Smith, who came from England and settled in Rhode Island, and his oldest son was Benjamin. The line of descent thenceforward is traced through Stephen, Simeon, Nicholas and finally Judge Smith. On the maternal side the Turtelott family were French Huguenots. Judge Smith's grandmother Dorcas Turtelott married Capt. Jonathan Aborn, who was master of a sailing vessel, and he died while on a voyage at Calcutta, India, in June, 1820. The family was established in Georgia by Nicholas Peck Smith, who in 1824 came to Tattnall County and established a mercantile enterprise. In 1832 he sent North for his family, and they made their home on the Altamaha River in Tattnall County, where he continued his career as a successful merchant and planter until his death in 1867 at the age of eighty years. His wife passed away in 1841. There was a large family of children, including the following: Dorcas, who died in Toombs County in February, 1911; Daniel, who died in Plainfield, New York; Urania, who married Farquhar McRae, and she died at Mount Vernon; Sheldon Perkins, next in age; Nicholas P., who died of yellow fever at Savannah in 1876; Mary A., who first married Dr. Lucien Tucker, and is now the widow of Dr. James Harrison and resides in Washington, D. C.; Elizabeth died in Liberty County, Georgia, in 1858; Robert A. died at Charleston, South Carolina, in 1863 from typhoid fever while in the Confederate army. The daughter’s, were all educated in the Ladies' Seminary at Warren, Rhode Island.\r\nJudge Smith finished his education under a private tutor, Col. J. S. Bradwell, at Hinesville, Georgia. For a number of years he was with his father in the store, until the latter's death, and then employed his resources in merchandising and planting in Tattnall County. The most prominent feature of his career, however, has not been his business success, but his official service. During the Civil war Governor Joseph E. Brown, the war governor of Georgia, appointed him justice of the peace for Tattnall, later Toombs County, and that office he filled with admirable ability and with an administration of justice which was firm but kindly, sympathetic and interested, for fully half a century, from 1863 until 1913. In 1913 Judge Smith was elected Judge of Probate or Ordinary for Toombs County, and in that dignified and useful office it is likely that he will spend his last days. Judge Smith has always been an admirer of the principles of Masonry, though he has never joined the order himself.\r\nOn December 5, 1853, in Tattnall County he married Miss Frances Bell, who was born in Tattnall County, a daughter of Joseph and Elizabeth E. (Johnson) Bell. Her mother was the daughter of Allen E. Johnson. After more than half a century of married companionship Mrs. Smith passed away in June, 1908. Thirteen children were born to her, and a number of them are still living and filling dignified and useful positions in the world. Elizabeth died in 1871; Frances E. is the wife of Harrison Clifton, of Toombs County; Dorcas married Henry Mann and died in Toombs County; Joseph B. is a resident of Kingsland, Georgia; Sheldon P. lives in Geneva, Florida; Nicholas was accidentally killed by the Southern Railway at Baxley, Georgia; Mary, who married Dan McMillan died in Montgomery County, Georgia; Octavia died in Tattnall County; Robert is now state representative from Toombs County and a farmer in that locality; Allen is an engineer for the Georgia Southern Railway at Valdosta; Daisy is the wife of J. A. Pearson, who alternates in residence between Savannah and Tattnall County; Simeon died in infancy; Louise lives at home with her father in Lyons.\r\nPrior to the war both Judge Smith and his father owned from forty to fifty slaves and conducted one of the largest plantations in Tattnall County. However, slavery was not an institution which Judge Smith favored, and he literally fought the secession movement in Georgia, and for that reason aroused much ill feeling and prejudice against him. The unpopularity of that time has long since passed away, and the views which he advocated almost alone have long since been accepted by the great majority of right thinking people.\r\n[below: Family lists according the original text, reformatted]\r\n| 1 | Dorcas | | died in Toombs County in February, 1911\r\n| 2 | Daniel | | died in Plainfield, New York\r\n| 3 | Urania | married Farquhar McRae | died at Mount Vernon\r\n| 4 | Sheldon Perkins | |\r\n| 5 | Nicholas P. | | died of yellow fever at Savannah in 1876\r\n| 6 | Mary A. | first married Dr. Lucien Tucker, and is now the widow of Dr. James Harrison and resides in Washington, D.

The origin of the personal name is Czechoslovakian, 'Wenze' being a borrowed form of the Old Czech personal name 'Veceslav', in modern Czech 'Vaclav', which in its Anglicized form is 'Wenceslas'. The name is composed of the elements 'vece', greater, and 'slav', glory, and was borne by a 10th Century duke of bohemia who fought against a revival of paganism in this territory, and after his death became patron saint of Bohemia. There are a number of variants of the name 'Wenzel(l)', such as 'Wentzel', 'Wanzel', and 'Fenzl', and the patronymic (son of Wenzel), 'Wen(t)zler'. One Christopher Wenzel married Elisabeth Braks at Spitalfields, Christchurch (London) in January 1780. The first recorded spelling of the family name is shown to be that of John Wenzell (marriage to Elisabeth Pope), which was dated April 27th 1766, St. Dunstan's, Stepney, London, during the reign of King George 111, 'Farmer George', 1760 - 1820. Surnames became necessary when governments introduced personal taxation. In England this was known as Poll Tax. Throughout the centuries, surnames in every country have continued to \"develop\" often leading to astonishing variants of the original spelling.\r\n© Copyright: Name Origin Research 1980 - 2017"},

Two years ago he was in the flood district in Texas, and lost everything they had, except what clothing they had on. For forty-eight hours they were marooned on a hill without food, surrounded by torrents of raging water. After they were rescued from their position on the hill, their food supply was short for nearly a week longer, as there was only one store in the vicinity above water and the food stuffs of this store were proportioned out to families on a very economical basis. As the waters subsided other stocks were uncovered, but much of the food stuffs were spoiled, but enough was saved to supply the people with enough to live on until the railroads were again in operation and brought i n supplies. But it was an experience Will does not want repeated, and as soon as possible he let go of his Texas holdings and moved to Washington County, Kansas. He says his crops this season were damaged, but that he raised enough to see him through the winter and he will enter upon his farm work with renewed energy and hope and expects to win out in the long run."},

He was married in Tattnall County on April 27, 1836 to Miss Susannah Sharpe, a daughter of John Thomas Sharpe and his wife Rebecca Lassiter. She was a native of Tattnall County, having been born there on Tuesday, February 1, 1820. The Cliftons made their home in the present-day Marvin community of Toombs County.\r\nWilliam Clifton served as Colonel of the 6th Regiment Militia, a position which he acquired on April 19, 1836. He was instrumental in defending the ar[ea?] in Indian conflicts in 1838. He was also prominent in politics and served as Justice of the Peace, Clerk of Court, Justice of the Inferior Court and stat representative at various times throughout the period prior to the Civil War.\r\nAccording to the \"Memoirs of Georgia\", William \"made a life pursuit of farming and stock raising, but having developed under the instruction of Christopher Bowland, the famous Irish mathematician, unusual mathematical ability, made an enviable reputation as a surveyor. He was employed by the United States Government to survey portions of the Cherokee country in north Georgia, and was highly complimented by the then governor of the state for the excellence of his work.\"\r\nColonel William Clifton died on his plantation in southern Toombs County (then Tattnall) on Sunday, December 21, 1873. He was buried in the Clifton Family Cemetery on the right side of this homeplace, adjacent to the Old River Road. Today, this cemetery is one of the best kept and tended resting places in all the county. William left a will recorded in the Tattnall County which divided his property amongst his children.\r\nHis widow, Susannah (Sharpe) Clifton, continued residing on the homeplace until her death on Saturday, February 21, 1904. Her remains were laid to rest beside her husband.\r\nMr. S. H. Whonic of Jesup, Georgia has done considerable research on this branch of the Clifton clan."},

The Cliftons came to Georgia in 1780 and made their home along the Great Ogeechee River at \"Clifton's Ferry\", south of Scarborough in present—day Jenkins County. After reaching adulthood, Ezekiel moved to Montgomery County to that section that was later cut into Tattnall County. He was married about 1795 to Miss Elizabeth Roberts, a daughter of Nathan Roberts. She was the same age as Ezekiel, having been born in 1773 in North Carolina. The Cliftons made their home in southeast Toombs County in present—day Marvin community. Ezekiel and Elizabeth were the parents of the following children:\r\n|| || Name || Born || Married\r\n| 1 | Nathan Clifton | Dec. 25, 1797 | Versaney\r\n| 1 | Nathan Clifton | Dec. 25, 1797 | Versaney\r\n| 2 | Elizabeth Clifton | Feb. 8, 1799 | Never Married\r\n| 3 | Martha Clifton | Jan. 23, 1801 | McLendon Ganey\r\n| 4 | William Clifton | Jun. 24, 1803 | Susannah Sharpe\r\n| 5 | Levin Clifton | Feb. 13, 1806 | Martha Ganey\r\n| 6 | Harriett Clifton | Jun. 1, 1808 | Rev.

He engaged in farming and stock raising, primarily hogs and goats. The Clifton plantation sat on a 400 acre tract of land bordering Pendleton Creek. Ezekiel also held title to property in other sections of the state, primarily Lowndes County and Houston County.\r\nEzekiel Clifton was elected as the first sheriff of Tattnall County, an office which he held for several terms. Having been elected Captain of the local militia, he became known state—vide for his leadership in numerous Indian battles. His service was instumental in the Battle at Echowanotchaway Swamp in Randolph County in west Georgia in late January of 1836.\r\nCaptain Ezekiel Clifton died at his home on Tuesday, August 17, 1852 and is said to have been laid to rest in the Old Clifton—harden Family Cemetery in Toombs County, on the property of Theron Morris. His will named his son William Clifton, Alexander McRae of Reidsville and Richard C.A. Bryan as executors of his estate. He left his daughter Elizabeth, a spinster, the plantation, provided that she care for her mother and to his son William, he left $1000. The remainder of his estate, which included goats, hogs, 295 bushels of corn and 1750 pounds of fodder, was divided amongst his heirs.\r\nElizabeth (Roberts) Clifton lived her golden years at the old homeplace with her daughter Elizabeth \"Betsy\" Clifton and died on December 21, 1873. Both she and Betsy were buried in the Old Clifton—Harden Family Graveyard.\r\nDates obtained by Mr. S. H. Whonic of Jesup, Georgia."},
